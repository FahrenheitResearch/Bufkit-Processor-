# Batch Processing Refactor Summary

## Overview
This refactor transforms the claude-bufkit system from sequential processing to efficient batch processing, enabling scalable downloading and processing of WFO meteorological data.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Batch Processing Architecture
- **`batch_fetch_and_process.py`**: Main batch processing orchestrator
- **`fetch_single_wfo.py`**: Individual WFO downloader (used by batch processor)
- **`run_batch_example.py`**: Usage examples and testing script

### 2. Enhanced Sounding Processor
- **Modified `sounding_processor/main.py`**: Added `--wfo` parameter for single WFO processing
- **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing batch processing

### 3. Configurable Batch Sizes
- **Download batches**: Default 10 WFOs per batch (configurable)
- **Processing batches**: Default 25 WFOs per batch (configurable)
- **Concurrent workers**: Default 3 concurrent download batches (configurable)

## Performance Improvements

### Before (Sequential)
- Downloads ~122 WFOs one by one
- Processes all data sequentially
- Single point of failure stops entire process
- No parallelization

### After (Batch)
- Downloads 10 WFOs in parallel batches
- Processes 25 WFOs per processing batch
- Individual failures don't stop other batches
- Configurable concurrency and batch sizes

## Usage Examples

### Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Download in batches of 10, process in batches of 25
python batch_fetch_and_process.py 2023-10-26 ./wfo_data_archive --hour 12 --model HRRR RAP
```

### Custom Batch Sizes
```bash
# Smaller batches for testing
python batch_fetch_and_process.py 2023-10-26 ./wfo_data_archive \
  --download-batch-size 5 --process-batch-size 15 --max-download-workers 2
```

### Separate Phases
```bash
# Download only
python batch_fetch_and_process.py 2023-10-26 ./wfo_data_archive --download-only

# Process only (after downloads complete)
python batch_fetch_and_process.py 2023-10-26 ./wfo_data_archive --process-only
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability
- Handles large numbers of WFOs efficiently
- Configurable resource usage
- Easy to scale up or down based on system capacity

### Fault Tolerance
- Individual WFO failures don't stop entire batches
- Comprehensive error logging and statistics
- Graceful degradation under partial failures

### Resource Management
- Controlled memory usage through batch processing
- Configurable concurrent workers prevent system overload
- Sequential processing phase prevents resource contention

### Monitoring & Logging
- Detailed batch-level statistics
- Individual WFO success/failure tracking
- Comprehensive logging to `batch_processing.log`

## File Structure Changes

### New Files
- `batch_fetch_and_process.py` - Main batch orchestrator
- `fetch_single_wfo.py` - Single WFO downloader
- `run_batch_example.py` - Usage examples
- `test_batch_structure.py` - Structure validation

### Modified Files
- `sounding_processor/main.py` - Added single WFO processing
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with batch processing documentation

### Legacy Files (Still Functional)
- `fetch_all_daily_data_multi_model.py` - Original sequential downloader
- All original sounding processor files remain unchanged

## Backward Compatibility

The refactor maintains full backward compatibility:
- All existing scripts continue to work
- Original command-line interfaces unchanged
- Existing configuration and data formats preserved
- Legacy workflows remain functional

## Testing

Run the structure validation test:
```bash
python test_batch_structure.py
```

Try the example scripts:
```bash
python run_batch_example.py
```

## Summary Statistics

- **122 WFOs** total in system
- **Default: 10 WFO download batches** (12-13 batches total)
- **Default: 25 WFO processing batches** (5 batches total)
- **Default: 3 concurrent download workers**
- **Estimated throughput improvement**: 3-10x depending on system resources

The refactored system provides significant performance improvements while maintaining reliability and backward compatibility.
