.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 344 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A potent shortwave trough swinging through the Ohio River Valley 
this morning is dragging a weak cold front through the Florida 
Panhandle. This front will slowly push into the Florida Peninsula 
today and tonight, and is forecast to stall out across southwest 
Florida by Thursday. A few showers or perhaps storms will be 
possible along and ahead of the front today, mainly over the 
Nature Coast and into the Tampa Bay area, although there is not 
enough moisture present for significant convection. Otherwise the 
front will drop temperatures slightly Thursday morning, but only 
to around near normal levels.

Broad high pressure north of Florida will ridge into the area 
Thursday and Friday, allowing temperatures to creep back upwards 
under mostly sunny skies and winds becoming easterly and 
northeasterly. The next system will approach the area this weekend, 
as a closed low aloft ejects from the southern Plains into the 
southeastern US and Ohio River Valley. Models have come into 
better agreement with the timing of the associated front pushing 
weakly into the Florida Peninsula on Monday, with isolated rain 
chances over the Nature Coast forecast for the weekend as 
moisture increases ahead of the system. That said, the upper level
support is once again lifting too far north for this front to 
bring a significant cool down or more widespread rain chances.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 344 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A few patches of fog will be possible around sunrise, but any flight 
category disruptions should lift out by around 14z. A few showers or 
storms will be possible this afternoon and evening along a weak cold 
front, with the highest rain chances around KTPA/KPIE/KSRQ. Rain 
free and VFR conditions should return again by around 03z.

.MARINE...
Issued at 344 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A weak cold front will push southeast into the waters today and 
tonight and stall out by Thursday, with southwest winds this morning 
turning to westerly and northerly behind the front. Winds will 
generally remain less than 15 knots, but a few showers or storms 
will be possible today along and ahead of the front, causing locally 
higher winds and seas. High pressure will build in north of the 
waters Thursday and Friday, then another weak front will approach 
the area this weekend, bringing more chances for rain.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 344 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

No humidity concerns through the rest of the week. Some patchy high 
dispersion indices will be possible this afternoon, mainly over the 
interior.
