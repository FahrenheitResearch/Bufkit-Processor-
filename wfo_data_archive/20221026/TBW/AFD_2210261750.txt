.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 145 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The showers associated with the cold front have finally begun to 
move onshore along the nature coast. This line of showers will 
continue to move over the peninsula, and may bring a couple of 
showers to the Tampa area. Inland and southern sites are less likely 
to see any precipitation from this front. It is expected to stall 
over south Florida and could generate a couple showers tomorrow, but 
chances remain low for most of the area. High pressure builds 
back in Friday, bringing back drier and warmer conditions through 
Saturday. Sunday into Monday another weak cold front associated 
with a trough will make its way through the peninsula. Once again,
this front is only expected to bring isolated showers, leaving
most areas dry. Temperatures following today's front and Sunday's
are expected to drop a couple degrees, but overall temperatures 
will remain near normal.
