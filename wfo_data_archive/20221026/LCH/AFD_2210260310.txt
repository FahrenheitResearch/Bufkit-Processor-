.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday night) 
Issued at 403 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Dry weather will prevail through much of the short term period as
high pressure transits the region beneath a zonal flow aloft.
PWATs will be near seasonal minimums, between 0.3-0.4 inches,
resulting in clear nights and sunny days. The dry airmass will
also allow for an approximately 30 degree diurnal temperature
difference tonight through Thursday. Overnight lows the next 
couple of nights are expected to fall into the middle 40s across 
most of the area, with lower 40s possible in the typical cooler 
spots across central LA. Meanwhile, highs will generally be in the
middle 70s. 

Thursday will be a transition day as the next system to affect the
area digs across the western states while the surface high begins
to shift east. Highs on Thursday are not expected to be much
warmer than Wednesday, but a slight uptick in low level moisture
can be expected as winds begin veering east to southeast during 
the day. Moisture will increase and deepen Thursday night as winds
aloft become southwesterly in advance of the shortwave trough 
digging southeast toward the southern plains. Increasing ascent
and diffluence aloft will prompt an increase in rain chances west
to east Thursday night.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through next Monday) 
Issued at 403 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Rain chances will increase early Friday as a short wave and surface 
low approaches the region. Moisture will be increasing with PWATs 
climbing into the 75% to 90% above the climo average range and 
dewpoints into the 60s ahead of the surface low. Conditions do not 
appear overly impressive for severe weather at this time, however 
sufficient enough to produce at least isolated severe or strong 
storms Friday with some also producing heavy rain. 'Tis the severe 
weather season in SETX and LA.

The upper disturbance is anticipated to lift northeast Saturday with 
rain chances gradually decreasing, however wrap around moisture may 
still affect the area into Sunday.

Dry with near climo average temperatures (70s/50s) are anticipated 
early next week.

.MARINE...
Issued at 403 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

High pressure building into the region will maintain elevated
northwesterly winds tonight, with winds becoming northerly and
diminishing on Wednesday. Light to moderate offshore flow will
continue through Wednesday night as the high slides east across
the region. Winds will veer east to southeast on Thursday into
Thursday night, with an area of low pressure expected to bring
increased rain chances on Friday. Offshore flow will develop
Friday night into Saturday with the passage of the surface low.
