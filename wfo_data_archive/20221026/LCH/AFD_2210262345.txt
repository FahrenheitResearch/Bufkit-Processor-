.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 310 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The cold front that passed the region yesterday is found from the
SE Atlantic coast into the eastern Great Lakes. Behind this front
high pressure stretches from south central Canada to northeast 
Mexico this afternoon with a cool and dry Canadian air mass 
filling the central sections of the U.S. Another system is moving
into the western states.

Tonight into Thursday the ridge across the central sections of the
country will continue east, but not before giving our area another
clear and cool night. Locations along the coast will be in the 50s
with the 40s found inland. The ridge will move east of the
Mississippi Valley tomorrow which will begin the return flow
locally by afternoon.

Moisture will be on the increase Thursday afternoon through Friday
as another surface low develops and moves into north Texas farther
increasing the east to southeast flow. 

A vigorous short wave will approach the northern gulf coast 
Friday afternoon into the night with a surface low moving east 
along the SE Texas coast. The surface low is expected to move 
inland across SW LA potentially limiting the spread of higher 
depends too far inland, however enough moisture and lift will be 
in place for widespread rain and potentially isolated strong to 
severe storms, but the highest risk (marginal) will be coastal 
SETX/SWLA and into Acadiana.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through next Tuesday)
Issued at 310 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

As we start the long term portion of the forecast period, 
convection/squall line associated with the passing cutoff low 
aloft/sfc frontal system will be quickly exiting the forecast area. 
Although wrap around low-level moisture is progged to encroach the 
region from the north, building heights aloft behind the departing 
low will keep any potential additional precip at bay through the 
remainder of Saturday into Saturday night. With the early arrival of 
cooler air, highs on Saturday will be held in the upper 60s to lower 
70s, primarily over the Atchafalaya Basin.

After a couple of dry and somewhat cooler days Sunday/Monday as 
nwrly flow aloft/sfc high pressure prevail, the development of a srn 
stream system and its approach, accompanied by good low-level 
moisture, looks to spell at least increased cloud cover for the mid-
week time frame. Mid-level ridging just to our north may provide 
enough capping to limit any precip to the coastal waters to end the 
long-range period.

(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 634 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions and fairly light winds to prevail through the 
period as high pressure builds in from the north starting 
tonight. Tomorrow, winds will begin to turn to the east and then 
southeast as the axis of high pressure slides into southeast 
Louisiana. This will take place throughout the late morning and
early afternoon.

.MARINE...
Issued at 310 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A moderate east to southeast flow will be found across the 
coastal waters through Thursday and into Thursday night. The
gradient will tighten into Friday as a surface low approaches. An
SCA may be needed Friday and as a front passes Friday night into
Saturday. A moderate northwest flow will linger through Sunday and
Monday.
