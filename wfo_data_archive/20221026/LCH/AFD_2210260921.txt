.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 345 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A very quiet weather pattern across the region this morning as the
activity from yesterday is moving through north Florida and south
Georgia attm. A large surface high has spilled in behind the front
this morning and extends from the Canadian border south into deep
south Texas. This area of high pressure will drift eastward over 
the next several days and into the northeast US before exiting the
New England states towards Friday. Until then a quiet weather
pattern today and tomorrow with afternoon highs in the upper 70s
and morning lows in the 40s Thursday morning and 50s on Friday
morning. 

An area of low pressure will move out of the south central rockies
into northwest Texas and western Oklahoma. This will the next
weather maker for this region. The surface low will deepen by 
assisted by energy sweeping down from the north and into west
Texas. As this happens the next round of showers are expected
Friday morning. Storms will increase in area and strength and 
with a marginal chance that a few storms may become severe on
Friday ahead of the front. The main threat will be winds although
isolated tornadoes can not be ruled out. Therefore looking at the
area coverage and strength increasing through the day on Friday. 
The threat for storms will taper off early Saturday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 345 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The long term kicks off with a strong upper level low centered over 
ETX to WLA and attached cold front that will already be sweeping 
through the area by this period. Severe weather, if any, will depend 
on how far the low gets to our area before trekking northeast. 
Severe parameters are not looking all too impressive by Saturday 
morning, thus we are not in a severe thunderstorm risk area. However 
with dewpoints and pwats being high and above climatological norms, 
heavy rain can be expected. QPF totals from a 24h period ending at 
the beginning of the extended are 1-2 inches with locally higher 
amounts. We are in a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall however 
widespread flooding is unlikely. Soils are dry and in much need of 
rain. The upper low will make its way northeast with flow overhead 
becoming northwesterly to westerly. Not looking at any wrap around 
precip, but cloud cover will be present until around Halloween when 
the upper level low is further away from the area and a surface low 
starts to build in.

Post frontal afternoon temperatures will start off in the upper 60s 
to low 70s with a warmup into seasonal temps going into the 
beginning of November. By early to mid next week high temperatures 
will rise into the upper 70s to 80s. Post frontal lows will be in 
the upper 40s to low 50s with them warming into the mid 50s to 60s 
by the end of the period.
