.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 652 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Notably colder tonight with lows near freezing and decreasing
clouds. There will be a gradual warming trend through the
remainder of the week with dry conditions until Sunday afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(This Evening through Thursday)
Issued at 253 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The shortwave associated with this morning's rain pushes away from 
the area during the afternoon. Behind the shortwave, drier air moves 
into the region in conjunction with the arrival of surface high 
pressure and slight mid level ridging. Additionally, a 30 kt low 
level jet associated with the pressure gradient and mixing up to 
around 850 mb allows for gusty winds up to around 30 mph into the 
afternoon before the gradient and mixing relaxes by late afternoon.

While the low level temperatures stay above freezing, the lows 
tonight will have the potential to dip down into the low 30s as 
winds relax. Some lake enhanced cloudiness may linger a couple 
counties away from Lake Michigan into tonight, which may provide a 
little bit of a floor for low temperatures there.

Cooler temperatures on easterly wind trajectories will be across the 
area on Thursday as highs are only able to rise up into the low to 
mid 50s, which is just below normal by around 5 years. Surface high 
pressure will be overhead allowing for dry weather. Areas away from 
Lake Michigan will likely see plenty of sunshine, especially to 
start the day. Meanwhile, an upper low level pressure system dives 
southeast into the Southern Plains, but the jet structure is such 
that it will help push some moisture in the form of cloud cover into 
areas southwest of US-30 by mid to late afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday Night through Wednesday)
Issued at 253 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Friday starts our long term section with one upper jet to the
north and another our south as surface high pressure slips out to
our east. This set up allows for warming return flow on the 
western side of the high pressure system and a return to normal or
perhaps slightly above normal temperatures for Friday through 
Sunday. Even as the surface high pressure system slips off to the 
east, mid level ridging remains and this provides a dry period of 
weather from this afternoon through much of Sunday. 

By Sunday, the aforementioned upper level low pressure system 
approaches the area. There still remains some uncertainty with how 
quickly this system will be able to approach the area on Sunday as 
is often the case with cut-off systems arriving from the 
Southwestern US. Then, a second shortwave arrives from the Pacific 
and this catches up with the slowly departing and lumbering low 
pressure system later Sunday, which may extend the time period of 
light rainfall into Monday. Temperatures during this time period 
stay right around normal.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Thursday Evening)
Issued at 652 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Lake induced clouds will exit SBN shortly according to satellite,
while clouds likely stick around at KFWA for a least the next 
several hours. I have Medium-high confidence that ceilings will 
remain VFR. Wind gusts will continue to diminish within the hour 
as the pressure gradient relaxes and high pressure settles in. An
easterly wind takes hold tomorrow with high pressure over Lake
Michigan.
