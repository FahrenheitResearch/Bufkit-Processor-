.SYNOPSIS...

18Z surface data has strong low pressure just east of KFAM. The main

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Wednesday)
Issued at 251 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

The back edge of the rain shield runs from roughly Dubuque, IA to 
Kirksville, MO. Rain will continue east of this line through sunset 
with temperatures remaining in the 40s.

After sunset, the back edge of the rain shield will slowly move east 
as the low moves up into the Ohio Valley. Several hours before 
sunrise Wednesday the rain will clear the far eastern parts of the 
area.

Dry and near seasonable temperatures can be expected on Wednesday 
with clearing skies.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 251 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Key Messages:

1. Quiet weather returns to the area.
2. Negligible chances for pops through the period. 

Discussion:  

Zonal flow expected through the rest of the week.  A closed upper 
low is expected to slowly lumber east through the weekend.  This low 
glance the area on Sunday, leading to very slight chance pops across 
the far south and east.  After this, SW flow returns to start the 
work week as temperatures look to reach the upper 60s a week from 
today.

Standard anomaly data suggests low impact weather through the period 
as we mainly see surface high pressure through most of the long 
term.  Moisture associated with the closed low will lift into the 
area during the day Sunday as the closed low is absorbed back into 
the flow and ejects to the NE into Monday.  Only real CVA is with 
the low Thursday and then again Sunday.  Expect more sun than clouds 
through the period with winds mainly 10 kts or less.

.AVIATION...(For the 06Z TAFS through 06Z Wednesday night)
Issued at 1225 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions are expected through the period. NW winds will be
sustained at around 10 kts and occasionally gust higher (15-20 kts)
into mid afternoon, then diminish to light and variable by tonight
as high pressure builds in.
