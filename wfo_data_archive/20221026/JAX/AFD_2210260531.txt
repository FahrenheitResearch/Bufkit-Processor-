...New AVIATION...

.UPDATE...
Issued at 835 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Mid-high clouds will continue spreading over the forecast area
Tonight. A band of showers over eastern AL will move eastward
across the western half of GA later Tonight, with a few showers
entering our western counties before dawn. Current forecast looks
good...thus no significant changes made in update.

.NEAR TERM...
(Through Tonight)
Issued at 333 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Mostly sunny and warm conditions expected the rest of the 
evening, with winds 5-10 knots, calming down after sunset. Clouds 
will continue to slowly increase tonight ahead of approaching and 
weakening frontal boundary, with some shower activity reaching 
inland SE GA counties towards morning. 

Milder overnight lows expected around 60 degrees inland and 
mid 60s coast, while the increasing clouds and slight increase in
southerly winds should keep any fog formation from becoming dense
but if the front slows or cloud cover is less than expected,
patchy inland fog may form before sunrise.

Over the next couple of days there will be elevated water levels 
on the St Johns River Basin/Atlantic Coast due to the peak tides 
during the current New Moon phase. Most high tides will remain 
below Minor Flood Stage with "Action/Elevated" water levels 
expected and not planning any Coastal Flood Advisories at the 
moment.

.SHORT TERM...
(Wednesday through Thursday night)
Issued at 333 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

The incoming cold front from the northwest will bring moisture 
ahead, allowing for scattered showers and possibly isolated 
thunderstorms on Wednesday. Showers should begin in inland SE GA 
early Wednesday morning, likely before sunrise, and gradually push
southeasterly. Most of the precipitation activity should end in 
the early evening timeframe Wednesday, with a few coastal showers 
in NE FL possible until around sunset. Following the passage of 
this front, winds will shift from southerly to northerly, bringing
dry air on Thursday.

High temperatures Wednesday and Thursday will be near 80 degrees
inland, and upper 70s on the coast. Low temperatures will be in
the 50s for most of our area Wednesday night, but rise up to near
60 on Thursday night. On the coast, lows will be in the mid 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through next Tuesday)
Issued at 333 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Elevated convergent northeasterly flow will bring isolated 
showers onshore starting Friday afternoon on the coast, increasing
to scattered coverage Saturday into Sunday area-wide. Another 
cold front is expected to move into SE GA and NE FL Monday, 
leaving dry air in it's wake on Tuesday. 

Temperatures during this period will be fairly normal, with highs
in the mid to upper 70s for inland SE GA, near 80 in inland NE FL,
and the upper 70s on the coast. Low temperatures forecasted to
be around 60 degrees inland and in the upper 60s on the Atlantic
coast.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 129 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions are expected through the majority of the period as
a decaying and slowing cold front presses west to east across the
area today. Multilayered cloud cover is expected but ceilings are
expected at or above 3-4 kft. Low chances for rain/storms;
however, continued a mention of vicinity showers as the frontal 
boundary moves through area terminals. Winds will trend 
southwesterly through the day and feature gusts around 12-17 kts 
during between 16-22z. The frontal wind shift will turn winds WNW 
and then NW this evening, roughly between 23-04z, while clouds 
scatter out.

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 333 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Offshore winds will develop ahead of the approaching cold front on
Wednesday, then turn from southwesterly to northwesterly behind 
it Wednesday night into Thursday. Showers are expected with the 
frontal passage with isolated thunderstorms possible on Wednesday.
Winds are expected to stay northeasterly through the end of the 
week, with more potential for scattered showers this weekend. 

Rip Current Risk: Low risk of rip currents expected Wednesday.
