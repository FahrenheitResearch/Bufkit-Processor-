...UPDATE TO SHORT TERM...

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 1202 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Short range models show an upper level trough of low pressure 
dropping south-southeast through the Great Basin tonight and into 
the Four Corners Region early tomorrow, setting up an increasingly 
difluent southwest flow aloft across the Western High Plains. Lee 
side cyclogenesis is still projected late tonight/early morning 
Thursday across southeast Colorado and northeast New Mexico in 
response to the approaching system. The strengthening low is then 
expected to shift southeast into west Texas by Thursday afternoon 
with an attendant frontal boundary extending northeast into western 
Kansas. Although the bulk of the upper level system will track just 
to our south, a few showers will still be possible during the day as 
H5 vort maxima eject out of the advancing trough axis, lifting 
northeast and interacting with the frontal boundary in western/central
Kansas. A lack of deep moisture and weak QPF fields suggest minimal
potential rain amounts for those that see any rain at all.

Temperatures will not be quite a cool tonight as prevailing southerlies
draw slightly warmer air into western Kansas. Lows are expected to
range from the mid/upper 30s(F) in west central Kansas to the lower/mid
40s(F) farther south and east. Increased cloud cover and possible areas
of light rain ahead of an approaching cold front will result in cooler
temperatures tomorrow. Highs are only expected to reach the 50s(F)
in west central Kansas to possibly the lower/mid 60s(F) closer to the
Oklahoma border.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 153 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The main challenge in the later periods will be precipitation 
chances Thursday and Thursday night. Also early next week it 
appears that fire weather will once again be a concern. 
 
GEFS and ECMWF ensembles were similar to previous runs with the 
track of an upper low crossing northeast New Mexico and then 
moving out into the Southern Plains Thursday night and Friday. The
focus for the best opportunity for widespread precipitation still
appears to stay south of the Oklahoma border given the track of 
the upper low, moisture return, and 850 to 700mb forcing ahead of 
this upper level system. Still given this outlook there will be a 
chance for some light/very light precipitation late Thursday 
through early Friday as some moisture accompanies a mid level 
baroclinic zone as it crosses western Kansas and weak diffluence 
aloft develops north of the upper low track. A period of steady 
rainfall also can not be completely ruled out north and east of 
the Dodge City area on Thursday given that the latest 
deterministic models all are in decent agreement with a weak upper
wave rotating around the upper low and crossing Central Kansas. 
Rainfall totals Thursday through Thursday night from the 
precipitation that does develop from this upcoming event will 
generally average less than 0.05” with the possible exception of 
this on Thursday will be in the Hays and Larned area as the upper 
wave crosses Kansas. The second area of possible higher rainfall 
and the more likely area will be Thursday night near the Oklahoma 
border southeast of Dodge City. A few locations in this area may 
receive accumulations of 0.25”. The latest probability of this 
higher rainfall accumulation Thursday night is 30-40%. 

Cloud cover Thursday through Friday will definitely impact 
temperatures. In areas where afternoon skies are mostly cloudy 
Thursday and/or Friday the probability will range from 30 to 50 
percent for temperatures to stay mainly in the upper 50s. On 
Thursday the area where these cooler temperatures are more likely 
to occur will be across north central and west central Kansas. The
coolest temperatures on Friday currently appear to be located 
across extreme southwest Kansas based on the cloud cover, forecast
low level temperature trends, and ECMWF EFI forecast. If however,
more afternoon sun develops then highs in near 65 will be 
possible.

Following these cool temperatures late week...a warming trend 
will return to southwest Kansas over the weekend and into early 
next week. Highs currently are expected to warm through the 60s 
over the weekend with highs in the 70s likely early next week. 
 
Along with the warmer temperatures dry and windy conditions will 
also be possible early next week given falling surface pressures 
along the lee of the Rockies as westerly downslope flow improves.
These developing gusty winds combined with the dry conditions 
will result in increased fire risk across southwest Kansas.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Thursday afternoon)
Issued at 1115 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions will prevail in vicinity of all TAF sites through 
early Thursday. South-southeasterly winds 15 to 30kt through late 
afternoon are expected to gradually subside somewhat late this 
evening through the overnight with loss of daytime heating.
