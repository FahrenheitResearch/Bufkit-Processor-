...UPDATE TO LONG TERM...

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 1202 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Short range models show an upper level trough of low pressure 
dropping south-southeast through the Great Basin tonight and into 
the Four Corners Region early tomorrow, setting up an increasingly 
difluent southwest flow aloft across the Western High Plains. Lee 
side cyclogenesis is still projected late tonight/early morning 
Thursday across southeast Colorado and northeast New Mexico in 
response to the approaching system. The strengthening low is then 
expected to shift southeast into west Texas by Thursday afternoon 
with an attendant frontal boundary extending northeast into western 
Kansas. Although the bulk of the upper level system will track just 
to our south, a few showers will still be possible during the day as 
H5 vort maxima eject out of the advancing trough axis, lifting 
northeast and interacting with the frontal boundary in western/central
Kansas. A lack of deep moisture and weak QPF fields suggest minimal
potential rain amounts for those that see any rain at all.

Temperatures will not be quite a cool tonight as prevailing southerlies
draw slightly warmer air into western Kansas. Lows are expected to
range from the mid/upper 30s(F) in west central Kansas to the lower/mid
40s(F) farther south and east. Increased cloud cover and possible areas
of light rain ahead of an approaching cold front will result in cooler
temperatures tomorrow. Highs are only expected to reach the 50s(F)
in west central Kansas to possibly the lower/mid 60s(F) closer to the
Oklahoma border.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 202 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Medium range models indicate a closed upper low shifting eastward 
through north Texas to begin the period Friday, limiting what any
light rain chances there are to our extreme southern fringe before
the system begins lifting northeast into the Central Plains Saturday.
Otherwise, much drier conditions resume through the weekend as weak
ridging aloft builds in across the Colorado Rockies and Western High
Plains. Prevailing northeasterlies due to a surface low shifting 
southeast across Texas will help reinforce a cooler air mass across
the high plains of western Kansas Friday. Depending on the timing
of expected cloud cover scattering out, look for highs in the upper
50s(F) to the lower 60s(F), possibly slightly higher if clouds clear
out soon enough. A gradual warming trend is expected to carry highs
well into the mid/upper 60s(F) by Sunday as weak ridging aloft 
approaches from the west.
