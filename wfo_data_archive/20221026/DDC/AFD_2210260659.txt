...Updated Short and Long Term Discussions...

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)
Issued at 153 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Key message today will be elevated fire weather conditions across
western Kansas.

Deterministic models were in good agreement this morning in 
moving our next upper level trough, located over the Pacific 
northwest earlier this morning, quickly moving southeast towards 
four corners region today. As this upper level system approaches 
from the west...an area of low pressure at the surface will begin
to develop across eastern Colorado. Increasing pressure gradient 
today due to falling pressures along the lee of the Rockies along 
with some slightly stronger winds aloft mixing down to the surface
will result in southeast winds increasing into the 20 to 25 mph 
range by mid afternoon across southwest Kansas. These increasing 
winds combined with the ongoing dry conditions will result in 
elevated fire weather conditions for several hours this Wednesday 
afternoon. Highs in the upper 60s still look on track given the 
forecast temperatures near the top of the mixed layer. 
 
Tonight's temperatures will not be as cold as the past few nights
given the increasing clouds that will be spreading into southwest
Kansas ahead of the approaching upper level trough and stronger 
winds near the surface.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 153 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The main challenge in the later periods will be precipitation 
chances Thursday and Thursday night. Also early next week it 
appears that fire weather will once again be a concern. 
 
GEFS and ECMWF ensembles were similar to previous runs with the 
track of an upper low crossing northeast New Mexico and then 
moving out into the Southern Plains Thursday night and Friday. The
focus for the best opportunity for widespread precipitation still
appears to stay south of the Oklahoma border given the track of 
the upper low, moisture return, and 850 to 700mb forcing ahead of 
this upper level system. Still given this outlook there will be a 
chance for some light/very light precipitation late Thursday 
through early Friday as some moisture accompanies a mid level 
baroclinic zone as it crosses western Kansas and weak diffluence 
aloft develops north of the upper low track. A period of steady 
rainfall also can not be completely ruled out north and east of 
the Dodge City area on Thursday given that the latest 
deterministic models all are in decent agreement with a weak upper
wave rotating around the upper low and crossing Central Kansas. 
Rainfall totals Thursday through Thursday night from the 
precipitation that does develop from this upcoming event will 
generally average less than 0.05” with the possible exception of 
this on Thursday will be in the Hays and Larned area as the upper 
wave crosses Kansas. The second area of possible higher rainfall 
and the more likely area will be Thursday night near the Oklahoma 
border southeast of Dodge City. A few locations in this area may 
receive accumulations of 0.25”. The latest probability of this 
higher rainfall accumulation Thursday night is 30-40%. 

Cloud cover Thursday through Friday will definitely impact 
temperatures. In areas where afternoon skies are mostly cloudy 
Thursday and/or Friday the probability will range from 30 to 50 
percent for temperatures to stay mainly in the upper 50s. On 
Thursday the area where these cooler temperatures are more likely 
to occur will be across north central and west central Kansas. The
coolest temperatures on Friday currently appear to be located 
across extreme southwest Kansas based on the cloud cover, forecast
low level temperature trends, and ECMWF EFI forecast. If however,
more afternoon sun develops then highs in near 65 will be 
possible.

Following these cool temperatures late week...a warming trend 
will return to southwest Kansas over the weekend and into early 
next week. Highs currently are expected to warm through the 60s 
over the weekend with highs in the 70s likely early next week. 
 
Along with the warmer temperatures dry and windy conditions will 
also be possible early next week given falling surface pressures 
along the lee of the Rockies in response to our next more 
significant upper level trough approaching from the west. These 
developing gusty winds combined with the dry conditions will 
result in increased fire risk across southwest Kansas.

.AVIATION...(For the 06Z TAFS through 06Z Wednesday night)
Issued at 1200 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A trough of low pressure at the surface will develop across
eastern Colorado Today as an upper level trough approaches from 
the west. This will result in the light/variable winds overnight 
becoming southeast at 10 to 15 knots early Wednesday morning. 
These southeast winds will continue to increase during the day 
with sustained winds of 20 to near 25 knots becoming possible 
between 18z and 21z Today. These gusty southwest winds will 
decrease into the 15 to 20 knots range between 00z and 03z 
Thursday. BUFR soundings indicating VFR conditions over the next 
24 hours. This does include some increase cloud cover in the 8000
to 12000ft AGL after 00z Thursday.
