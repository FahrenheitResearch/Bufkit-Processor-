.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Wednesday)
Issued at 1205 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Tranquil conditions will continue tonight into Wednesday despite an 
intensifying zonal flow aloft. Surface high pressure shifting out of 
the Northern High Plains into the Dakotas and Nebraska will reinforce
a cooler/drier air mass across the Western High Plains, limiting any
instability. This will keep any precip chances out of western Kansas
through late Wednesday afternoon. Under mostly clear skies, the drier
air mass combined with light and variable winds will allow lows to
drop well into the 30s(F) tonight. Despite departing surface high
pressure giving way to southeasterly upslope winds by early Wednesday
afternoon, this will do very little to erode the cooler air mass across
the region. Look for highs back up into the mid/upper 60s(F) as a
result.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 137 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Medium range models continue to indicate an upper level trough of 
low pressure dropping southeast out of the Pacific Northwest into 
the Four Corners Region early Thursday, setting up an increasingly 
difluent southwest flow aloft across the Western High Plains. In 
response, lee side cyclogenesis is projected across southeast 
Colorado and northeast New Mexico ahead of an approaching cold front.
Meanwhile, a prevailing southeasterly upslope flow will help draw 
modest moisture up into central and portions of southwest Kansas, 
though introducing very minimal instability at best. Still, showers 
will be possible Thursday afternoon through Thursday evening as H5 
vort maxima begin to eject northeast out of the trough axis dipping 
into New Mexico, interacting with the cold front pushing into 
western Kansas. An isolated thunderstorm or two cannot be ruled out 
closer to south central Kansas where a small amount of instability
may be present. Drier conditions take hold Friday into the weekend
as the aforementioned upper low shifts east through Texas before 
lifting northeast into the Central Plains.

Increased cloud cover and cooler air filtering into western Kansas 
behind an advancing cold front will result in lower temperatures 
Thursday. Expect highs only up into the 50s(F) in west central 
Kansas to the 60s(F) farther southeast into south central Kansas. A 
gradual warming trend is then expected by the weekend as low level 
southerlies return to western Kansas.

.AVIATION...(For the 06Z TAFS through 06Z Wednesday night)
Issued at 1200 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A trough of low pressure at the surface will develop across
eastern Colorado Today as an upper level trough approaches from 
the west. This will result in the light/variable winds overnight 
becoming southeast at 10 to 15 knots early Wednesday morning. 
These southeast winds will continue to increase during the day 
with sustained winds of 20 to near 25 knots becoming possible 
between 18z and 21z Today. These gusty southwest winds will 
decrease into the 15 to 20 knots range between 00z and 03z 
Thursday. BUFR soundings indicating VFR conditions over the next 
24 hours. This does include some increase cloud cover in the 8000
to 12000ft AGL after 00z Thursday.
