...UPDATED FOR AVIATION...

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 400 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A mostly quiet Wednesday is expected before more active weather 
arrives Wednesday night and into Thursday. High pressure will slowly 
drift eastward today giving way to an upper level trough to dig 
south across the central Plains by the evening. This trough will 
bring some isolated chances of precipitation to western and north 
central Nebraska. Despite temperatures dropping overnight tonight, 
the current expectations is that all precipitation will remain 
liquid as boundary layer and surface temperatures stay above 
freezing. Any previous mentions of rain/snow mix or all snow have 
been taken out of the forecast during this issuance. While all of 
north central Nebraska could see some light rain, the best chance 
for any rainfall will be on Thursday and generally east of US-183. 
Here, up to a quarter inch (0.25 inches) of QPF is forecasted with 
the greatest amounts further east. The trough, and any 
precipitation, quickly pushes east with a return to dry conditions 
by Thursday evening as high pressure builds in behind the departing 
system.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 400 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A strong upper level low develops across the souther Plains keeping 
Nebraska in zonal flow through the weekend. Dry and cool conditions 
will result with temperatures remaining near normal (low to mid 60s) 
overnight lows dropping into the upper 20s to low 30s. 

The dry conditions continue through mid week as high pressure 
returns to the region keeping any weather systems out of the region. 
There's a low chance of the next weather system finally developing 
late next week which may bring some much needed precipitation. At 
this time, timing, strength, and precipitation type is uncertain. 
Model consistency at this stage is very low with some not even 
showing this system at all with others bringing it in as all snow or 
all rain. Details will become more clear as the environment gets 
sampled over the next several days.

.AVIATION...(For the 12Z TAFS through 12Z Thursday morning)
Issued at 617 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR is expected through Wednesday night for western and north
central Nebraska terminals. A couple aviation weather concerns
exist, however. South/southeast winds strengthen midday with gusts
around 20 kts. Cloud cover will also increase and ceilings will
gradually lower, with scattered rain showers developing in the
afternoon (mainly north / KVTN) with a greater potential for rain
coming overnight.
