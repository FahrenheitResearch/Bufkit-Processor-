...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, FIRE WEATHER...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1258 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

After a few days of light wind conditions across the Borderland, 
a quick hitting storm system will move in Thursday and stir up 
the winds again. The region will see westerly winds increase 
through the day, becoming windy for the afternoon and evening. 
Most locations will remain dry, with only the Sacramento mountains
seeing a reasonable chance for any precipitation. There may be 
isolated rain and high elevation snow for the afternoon and 
evening, but amounts will be quite light. A cold front quickly 
follows Thursday evening bringing cooler temperatures overnight 
and Friday. Through the weekend we see warmer, and calmer 
conditions, with dry weather continuing. Next week's weather 
generally fair and seasonal.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 1258 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SHORT TERM...Tonight and Tomorrow...
West flow aloft increases tomorrow ahead of a progressive upper low 
diving down from Four Corners and across central New Mexico. Lee low 
formation Thursday afternoon will result in another windy day across 
southern New Mexico and far west Texas. Winds will increase rapidly 
around the noontime hour, with trough passage timed for around 
sunset. Model soundings show fairly widespread sustained winds of 20 
to 30 mph with gusts up to 40 mph. Winds will be stronger over the 
high elevations, thus a Wind Advisory has been issued for most 
mountain and high zones. It will be worth securing outdoor holiday 
decorations. Winds shift to the north tomorrow evening behind a 
Pacific cold front.

The northern trajectory of the low suggests precipitation chances 
will be slim to none, given only marginal increases in moisture and 
a very slim timeframe of favorable synoptic lifting. Most locations 
will stay dry and mostly sunny Thursday afternoon, with the 
exception of the Sacramento Mountains/Lincoln National Forest where 
terrain enhancement may be enough to produce a light wintry mix. No 
significant accumulations are expected.

Generally expecting most zones to fully realize high temperatures 
Thursday afternoon, as we await cold front to arrive sometime in the 
evening hours. Highs should be quite similar to today, especially 
southward along the I-10 corridor.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through next Tuesday)
Issued at 1258 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

We begin the long term period with the quickly exiting upper low
over our eastern zones, but rapidly dipping SE into West Texas.
The evening hours on Thursday will see our winds veering from
westerly to northerly as a Pacific cold front pushing through from
the NNW. The cold air advection with the front will help to
decouple the stronger winds aloft from the surface, allowing for
winds to slacken through the evening, but the tighter surface
pressure gradient with the front, and building sfc high pressure
spilling in behind the front, will allow for a night of breezy
north winds, especially through the norther RG valley, and likely
also the Tularosa basin. Probably a 10-25 mph range, but no cross-
mountain flow to induce enhanced lee-side winds with this 
boundary. The moisture/dynamics with the main upper low/trough
will be quickly departing allowing for a rapid drying. Dewpoints
will crash hard into the 8-15 degree range, and PWATs will fall
into the 0.10-0.20" range. Temperatures overnight will be cooler,
with the CAA, dry air, and clear skies, but the winds/mixing will
likely keep the coldest air from settling keeping sfc temps a bit
warmer than they would be with calm conditions. 

Friday will be chilly behind the system/front, with highs back in
the 60s. A shortwave ridge will pass over in a progressive pattern
aloft. This will mean lighter winds and very dry conditions for 
lots of sunshine. For the weekend, a generally flat flow pattern
will mean deep westerlies aloft, keeping the region dry, and
encouraging a day to day warming across the region. Temperatures
should be back to very near seasonal averages by Sunday.

For Monday and Tuesday, the models pass a minor trough across the
region, but it passes with almost no moisture associated with it,
so it will go unnoticed, with really no appreciable weather
affects. Thus we continue with fair weather, meaning seasonal
temperatures, winds generally light to moderate, and mostly clear
skies.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1111 AM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions expected through the period with skies SKC,
becoming FEW-SCT150 Thursday morning. Winds 230-260 at 06-12KT,
we may see a few gusts to 20 knots in the early evening. Strong
winds and FROPA from the north tomorrow afternoon.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 1258 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Windy conditions return on Thursday with elevated fire danger due to 
continued dry conditions. A Pacific low will quickly move across New 
Mexico Thursday afternoon, bringing west winds 25 to 35 mph and 
gusts up to 45 mph over the high elevations. Winds will shift to the 
north Thursday night as a cold front passes. Dry air will remain in 
place with relative humidity falling to 20-30% midday. No wetting 
precipitation is expected.

Dry weather is expected to continue this weekend and into early next 
week with lighter winds decreasing fire danger. Smoke ventilation 
will be Poor Friday onward with wind speeds below 10 mph. 
Temperatures return to seasonal normals by Sunday, with RH 20-30% 
each afternoon.
