...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 202 AM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Quiet weather will continue on Wednesday before our next storm
system rolls in Thursday bringing cooler weather, windy
conditions, and a chance for light rain and snow showers in the
Sacramento Mtns. Quiet conditions resume yet again for the weekend
and into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 202 AM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Currently, we are expecting another cold morning in the Borderland. 
We have clear skies, dry conditions, and light winds which should 
help generate strong low level inversions in the valleys, and 
lowland deserts of southern NM and far west TX. 

Today, we continue under the influence of zonal flow aloft, which 
will induce westerly winds at the surface. We may have a few breezes 
during the afternoon hours, but nothing of significant impact. 
Temperatures will warm up as warm and dry air is advected towards 
us. Afternoon highs will be around 5 to 7 degrees warmer than 
yesterday. 

Tonight, generally fair weather continues. However, an upper level 
shortwave trough coming from the Pac NW will be approaching the area 
towards the very early morning hours. Actually, this system 
intensifies and becomes a closed low near the WY/UT/CO area while it 
tracks to the southeast. Meanwhile, lee cyclogenesis occurs over 
northeastern NM as this system approaches. Therefore, wind will 
start increasing in the higher elevations of the Black Range and the 
Sacramento Mountains in the early morning hours. Winds over the 
aforementioned mountain areas will be around 10 to 20 mph with gusts 
up to 30 mph. The strongest gusts will be in the eastern slopes, 
ridges, and passes of mountain areas. Otherwise, winds in the 
lowlands will be around 5 to 15 mph. Morning lows will be warmer as 
there will be more mixing of the lower atmosphere.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 202 AM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Our next storm system will dive south over the Four Corners
Thursday bringing windy conditions, a chance for light rain and 
snow showers in the Sacramento Mtns, and cooler temperatures on 
Friday. As the trough approaches the area, lee-troughing will set 
up on Thursday tightening the pressure gradient allowing for a 
windy day on Thursday. West winds of around 20-30mph look probable
during the mid-afternoon time frame. This does not appear to be a
slam dunk case where we may need a wind advisory as winds appear
to be near or just reaching advisory criteria. It is still too
early to tell exactly how strong the winds will be at this time. 
East slopes definitely have a better chance of reaching advisory 
criteria. Either way, anchor or bring in your Halloween 
decorations because it's going to be a windy day!

As far as the precipitation goes, the GFS, EC, and NAM still are 
hinting at some light precipitation in the Sacramento Mtns, 
perhaps with some light snow showers possible. Rain showers look 
to begin in the afternoon hours and after sunset, rain will
transition to snow. Accumulations are expected to stay very light,
and may only be a dusting of snow if anything.

Light ridging will take control over the area on Friday bringing
calm and dry conditions, but will still be a chilly day thanks to
the cold front. Temperatures gradually warm through the weekend
and into early next week, along with dry conditions with calm 
winds.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1111 AM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions expected through the period with skies SKC,
becoming FEW-SCT150 Thursday morning. Winds 230-260 at 06-12KT,
we may see a few gusts to 20 knots in the early evening. Strong
winds and FROPA from the north tomorrow afternoon.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 202 AM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Generally fair weather is expected today. Then a quick storm system 
glances through the northeastern fire zone NM-113. This system will 
bring some rain and snow showers. Snow levels are around 6000 ft. 
However, accumulations should be minimal, as this system passes 
quickly through the area. The main concern on Thursday will be wind. 
We are expecting west to southwest winds between 25 to 35 mph in the 
mountains, and 15 to 30 mph in the lowlands. Gusts will be up to 50 
mph and 45 mph, respectively. A cold front will push from the north 
on Thursday evening which will shift the wind direction to the north 
in the late afternoon and evening. Wind speeds will be slightly 
lower with the passage. However, the Tularosa Basin and the Sierra 
Lakes area may see some stronger gusts with the front. 

This weekend, we will have fair and benign weather behind this 
system as an area of high pressure develops. Warm and dry air will 
be advected towards us, leading to a slow warming trend. No 
significant fire weather hazards are expected through this period. 

Minimum relative humidity will be generally above 20% in the 
lowlands, and above 30% in the mountains. Ventilation rates will be 
fair to good today, then improve on Thursday due to the stronger 
winds. However, rates become mostly poor through the rest of the 
period.
