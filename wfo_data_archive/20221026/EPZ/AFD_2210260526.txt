...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 155 PM MDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Warmer but still cool temperatures are expected tomorrow under 
sunny skies. Windy conditions return on Thursday as a system 
passes by to the north. Below normal temperatures return on Friday
behind another Pacific cold front, with mild and dry autumn 
conditions next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 PM MDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Through the short term period, the region will remain in a flat 
flow pattern between an exiting low pressure storm system and a 
slowly approaching system. This will be a deep, dry, zonal flow 
regime which will keep the regions weather fair and benign for the
short term. After a night/morning of freezing to near freezing 
temperatures across at least 80% of the region, we will begin to 
see slow warming across the region, with the lowlands remaining 
chilly, but above freezing tonight. Area mountains will see 
another night of sub-freezing temperatures. With deep westerly 
flow, the region will remain dry and skies generally clear, with 
no chance of any precipitation. Wind direction will favor the 
south through west quadrant and remain in the light to around 10 
mph range for speeds.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday night through next Monday)
Issued at 155 PM MDT Tue Oct 25 2022

West flow aloft increases again on Thursday ahead of a progressive
upper low diving down from Four Corners and across central New
Mexico. Lee low formation Thursday afternoon suggests another
windy day across the forecast area. West winds 15 to 25 mph are
most likely, with peak gusts generally around 40 mph. This may
need a Wind Advisory for many zones, but the current forecast
projects conditions at or below Advisory criteria.

The northern trajectory or the low suggests precipitation chances
will be slim to none, given only marginal increases in moisture 
and a very slim timeframe of favorable synoptic lifting. Most
locations will stay dry and mostly sunny Thursday afternoon, with
the exception of the Sacramento Mountains where terrain
enhancement may be enough to produce a light wintry mix. No
significant accumulations are expected.

Our next Pacific cold front is timed to arrive Thursday evening,
quickly shifting winds to the north and maintaining breezy
conditions through the night. Temperatures fall to back to below
normal Friday, with lowland highs only reaching the mid-60's.
Didn't make any major adjustment from guidance, as it seems the
NBM is timing things well.

Dry weather and lighter winds return next weekend under ridging
flow aloft. Another warming trend begins on Saturday, pushing
temperatures closer to seasonal normals by the end of the month. 
Models diverge greatly early next week as they try to resolve 
shortwaves within very progressive flow. I wouldn't put much stock
into any individual model run at this time, but it is worth 
notice the majority of ensemble members keep the region dry into 
early November. The Halloween holiday also looks great for New 
Mexico and west Texas, with mild temperatures and light west flow.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1124 PM MDT Tue Oct 25 2022

VFR expected through the period with light winds tonight and SKC.
FEW250 at times on Wednesday into Wednesday evening with 
southwest winds 6 to 12 KTS during the afternoon. Dry with no VIS 
restrictions through the period.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 155 PM MDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Typically dry fall conditions to be expected through the weekend,
with a minor exception over the SACs on Thursday, where a fast 
dropping storm system will clip the range, and deliver low to 
moderate chances for a short window of rain and snow. Otherwise 
dry all other areas with generally deep westerly flow over the 
region. Temperatures will be trending up tonight and Wednesday. 
Lowlands should stay above freezing, while the mountains see more 
sub-freezing temperatures. Deep and dry NW and W flow has purged 
moisture, dropping dewpoints into the teens and 20s. This means 
lower humidity values with only moderate overnight recoveries, and
daily minimums in the teens and 20 percent ranges. 

The passage of the Thursday storm, mentioned above, will likely 
give only the SACs a chance at precipitation, but all areas will 
be impacted with strong winds. Southwest to west winds are 
expected to increase into the 30 to 45 mph range, but afternoon RH
values should remain above 15 percent. Wednesday and Thursday 
will be our warmest days, but the area maximum temperatures will 
top out right at, or slightly below, seasonal averages. 

Thursday night a cold front will drive in from the north as the 
system aloft exits. This will allow for cooler air to invade with 
lower temperatures Friday, slowly warming through the weekend. 
Winds will be much lighter Friday, and for the weekend. 
Ventilation rates will be poor to good Wednesday becoming 
excellent on Thursday, then returning to poor-fair-good Friday 
and through the weekend.
