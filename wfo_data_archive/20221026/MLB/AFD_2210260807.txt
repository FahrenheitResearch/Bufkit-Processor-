.DISCUSSION...
Today through Tonight...A weak frontal boundary located across SW GA 
and the FL Panhandle will approach the forecast area bringing 
increased cloudiness and a slight chance of showers later in the day 
and into the early evening. Dry air aloft combined with unimpressive 
lapse rates will limit CAPE values to less than 1000 J/kg and 
therefore, the chance for thunderstorms, although a stray lightning 
strike cannot be ruled out. PWAT values look to increase north of 
the Cape, with values up to 1.5" possible based on model guidance. 
Despite the return of moisture with this weak frontal boundary, PoPs 
will be no greater than 20% north of Osceola and central Brevard. 
Showers will move east through the late afternoon before moving 
offshore overnight, with the frontal boundary expected to stall 
across central FL tonight. Temperatures will be above normal today, 
though record highs will be out of reach, with highs in the mid to 
upper 80s across all of east central Florida, including the coast, 
due to a delayed sea breeze. Overnight lows in the mid to upper
60s.

Late Week...The weakening frontal boundary will slow across
central/south FL with some decay during Thu. Residual sfc 
troughing across central Fl to the Atlc coastal waters and NE FL 
will provide a focus point for some isold showers to develop Thu 
into Thu night. High pressure building across the Mid Atlc coast 
will bring a coastal surge to the NE FL waters the latter half of 
Fri. The most notable gradient conds for thunder look to persist 
north of the immediate area, however some coastal showers and a 
few marine storms are advertised to re-develop over the Atlc 
waters and be pushed to the coast mainly from Brevard Co northward
into Saturday. Best forcing for measurable rainfall during this 
time will reside over the central to northern zones with near to 
above normal temperatures continuing through Saturday. 

Extended...By Sunday, broad mid-level troughing will approach the
region from the lower MS Valley. Modestly unsettled conditions
accompanied by considerable mid to upper cloudiness wl eventually
bring an ill-defined surface front across the gulf to the peninsula
early Monday. The forecast early in the week remains dry over 
land. A lack of forcing precludes mention of rainfall at this time
in the extended period with no significant cooldown shown as well
through the end of the month.

.MARINE...
Issued at 256 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Today through Tonight...Generally favorable boating conditions today 
with seas 2-3 feet and winds out of the SW at 5 to 10 knots. The 
east coast sea breeze is expected to develop this afternoon along 
the Space and Treasure Coasts. In the late afternoon and into the 
overnight hours, some isolated showers and a stray lightning storm 
due to an approaching frontal boundary are possible across the near 
and offshore waters north of the Cape. Winds this evening become 
southerly before veering out of the W to NW as at 5-10 knots as the 
front settles over the local waters.

Late Week...With approach and passage of weak front into Thu 
winds then veer east component as the front washes out, increasing
to around 10 kts during the day and easing to 5-10 kts at night 
through Fri. Seas 2-3 ft in the nearshore waters, and 3-4 ft in 
the offshore waters through Fri. Some isolated showers, and
perhaps a brief storm will be possible.

Weekend...Boating conditions becoming poor to hazardous during 
the weekend. Initially north of the Cape. The pressure gradient 
tightens between high pressure over the CONUS and low pressure 
developing east of the Atlantic waters, causing winds to NErly 
winds to freshen and seas to build upwards of 7ft, due to long 
period swell arriving from the NE, through the weekend and early 
next week. Isolated to scattered showers will be possible as well.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 256 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions expected throughout the period. A weak frontal 
boundary will approach the area today, with only mention of VCSH at 
interior sites and KDAB as early as 17Z and continuing into the 
early evening. Winds primarily out of the SW across the interior, 
with a sea breeze development prompting winds along the coast to 
turn onshore at 10 kt or less. Stratocu likely at all sites, with 
cloud bases around 040-050 AGL and also around 080 AGL during the 
day. Winds becoming light and variable to calm overnight. Stratus is 
possible across the northern terminals after 06Z as the front 
settles over the area. This may be added in a later TAF package.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 256 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The St. Johns river at Astor will remain in Moderate Flood Stage 
for the foreseeable future. The river is currently around 3.8 feet
and is forecast to continue a slow decline through this weekend.

Near Deland, the river at 5.4 feet is forecast to fall from Major
to Moderate Flood Stage by Wednesday night or Thursday morning, 
then continue slowly declining through Moderate Flood stage 
through this weekend.

Near Sanford, the river will remain in Moderate Flood Stage into 
next week. The river is currently at 7.6 feet and is forecast to 
continue a slow decline.

At Geneva above Lake Harney, the river at 10.3 feet will remain 
in Major Flood Stage. The river is forecast to continue a slow 
decline, dropping from Major to Moderate Flood Stage by this 
weekend.
