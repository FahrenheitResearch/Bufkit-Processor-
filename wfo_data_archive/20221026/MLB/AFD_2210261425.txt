.UPDATE...
Issued at 1023 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

All's quiet across east central Florida at this hour. The 
frontal boundary that will drop into central Florida this evening 
and tonight currently extends from the eastern GOMEX to the 
Panhandle and in Georgia. The front will weaken as is approaches 
central Florida, and moisture return ahead of the front has be 
lacking (KTBW morning sounding rang in with a PWAT of just 1.50). 
That said a few showers, and maybe a thunderstorm with daytime 
heating, will be possible later this afternoon and evening ahead of 
the front, mainly from Kissimmee to Titusville northward. Have 
continued 20 pct rain chances for this area due to the possibility of 
showers rather than coverage, which is expected to be isolated. Also 
made a few tweaks to today's temperatures, but afternoon highs 
remain in the mid 80s for inland areas and low to mid 80s for the 
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
Issued at 1023 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Late Week...The weakening frontal boundary will slow across
central/south FL with some decay during Thu. Residual sfc 
troughing across central Fl to the Atlc coastal waters and NE FL 
will provide a focus point for some isold showers to develop Thu 
into Thu night. High pressure building across the Mid Atlc coast 
will bring a coastal surge to the NE FL waters the latter half of 
Fri. The most notable gradient conds for thunder look to persist 
north of the immediate area, however some coastal showers and a 
few marine storms are advertised to re-develop over the Atlc 
waters and be pushed to the coast mainly from Brevard Co northward
into Saturday. Best forcing for measurable rainfall during this 
time will reside over the central to northern zones with near to 
above normal temperatures continuing through Saturday. 

Extended...By Sunday, broad mid-level troughing will approach the
region from the lower MS Valley. Modestly unsettled conditions
accompanied by considerable mid to upper cloudiness wl eventually
bring an ill-defined surface front across the gulf to the peninsula
early Monday. The forecast early in the week remains dry over 
land. A lack of forcing precludes mention of rainfall at this time
in the extended period with no significant cooldown shown as well
through the end of the month.

.MARINE...
Issued at 1023 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Today-Tonight...Generally favorable boating conditions as a weak 
front drops into the local Atlantic waters tonight. Winds SW 5-10 
kts, becoming Srly 10 kts in the afternoon with the sea breeze 
circulation, then returning to SW-W 5-10 kts before veering NWrly 
behind the front tonight. Isolated showers and a thunderstorm will 
be possible ahead of the front north of The Cape. Seas 2-3 feet.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 1023 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Mainly VFR conditions through the TAF period. A weak frontal 
boundary dropping into Florida is expected to reach the northern 
terminals this evening, then stall across central Florida Thursday. 
ISO SH/TS possible this afternoon and evening ahead of the front 
from KLEE to north of KTIX. Low TS confidence and SH coverage, so 
just VCSH at KDAB/KISM/KLEE/KMCO starting 17Z at KLEE and 20-21Z for 
the rest of the northern terminals. Winds SW around 8 kts, coastal 
terminals becoming S around 10 kts in the afternoon with the sea 
breeze, then becoming light and variable tonight. Continuing to keep 
an eye on guidance and trends for some stratus development tonight, 
especially the northern terminals north of the frontal boundary.
