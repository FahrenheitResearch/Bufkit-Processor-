.NEAR TERM...
(Now through Thursday)
Issued at 228 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Upper level high pressure will dominate the weather pattern in the
near term forecast. Northerly surface winds will help to enhance
advection of stable and drier air into the region. As a result,
rain chances will be basically zero tonight through tomorrow night.

Rip Current Risk will be low tonight through tomorrow night. MSW

.SHORT TERM...
(Thursday night through Saturday night)
Issued at 228 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Rain chances are expected to remain low on Friday into early
Saturday morning. Southerly surface winds ahead of an upper level
low will help to reintroduce moisture and warm air back into the 
environment, which will enhance instability. An upper level trough
is expected to influence the area Saturday into Sunday, enhancing
rain chances for the area. Upper level divergence will act to 
enhance the lifting in the environment ahead of the system as 
well. Rain chances will be high with PoPs in the mid-80s, 
especially during the morning and daytime hours Saturday. There is
plenty of deep layer moisture, but CAPE will be around 500J/kg, 
which will be enough to see some thunderstorms, but overall will 
limit development of strong to severe storms. Shear looks adequate
at 30-60kts, so some gusty strong to severe winds will still be a
concern. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty in the model 
guidance regarding the timing of the system, so we will have to 
see how it develops over the next couple of days. But overall,
decent shear and moisture, but limited instability means that
storms will struggle to fully develop/grow unless enhanced by
daytime heating or strong forcing. MSW

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Wednesday)
Issued at 228 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Sunday afternoon through the beginning of next week, the system 
will push eastward. Westerly to northerly winds will enhance cold 
air and dry air advection into the area, increasing stability in 
the environment. Looking at the models, rain chances will be low 
Sunday through Wednesday as more northerly flow domiantes the 
pattern and dry, stable air moves into the area. MSW

.MARINE...
Issued at 228 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Winds will be northerly and strong (15-20kts) overnight tonight
through 12Z Thursday. An Exercise Caution headline is in effect
for Small Craft overnight through the early morning hours, as a
result. Winds will be northerly to easterly and moderate (<15
knots) Thursday through Saturday morning. Winds will be southerly
and strong (20-25kts) Saturday through Sunday. Winds will be
northerly and moderate (<15 knots) Monday through Wednesday. Wave
heights will correspond to the wind speeds. MSW
