Residual MVFR to IFR ceilings along and east of a line from near 
K79J to KHRT as of 26.05Z will quickly move east of the area over
the next 1-2 hours ahead of an advancing cold front. VFR
conditions are expected to prevail through Wednesday afternoon
underneath mainly clear skies. Northwesterly to northerly winds up
to around 10 knots are expected through Wednesday. /21

MESOSCALE UPDATE...

Issued at 730 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

An upper level trough is crossing the Mid-Mississippi Valley
region and adjacent portions of northern MS/northwest AL early
this evening. Area surface observations indicate that the
associated cold front is currently pushing across southeast MS 
and interior portions of southwest AL. The area of ascent ahead of
the trough axis and the resultant narrow band of scattered to
broken convection has pushed into south central AL and the western
FL panhandle out ahead of the front early this evening. Convection
has remained rather weak and the Tornado Watch that was earlier in
effect for Choctaw and Wilcox counties was cancelled. A plume of
enhanced low level moisture with associated surface dewpoints
ranging from around 70 to the mid 70s continues to extend
northward across the western FL panhandle and adjacent south
central AL this evening and is still contributing to MLCAPE values
between 1000-1500 J/KG per SPC mesoanalysis this evening, while
effective shear values still remain enhanced between 35-45 knots
over this portion of the CWA. Low level SRH values up to around
200 m2/s2 also resides over eastern portions of our area early 
this evening, so we still cannot rule out a couple of strong 
storms or a severe storm capable of locally strong wind gusts and 
possibly exhibiting some rotation until the line exits our area 
over the next couple of hours. We will be watching radar trends 
closely. Will likely be making some adjustments to the POPs as the
line continues to shift eastward this evening. /21

A broken line of showers continues to push eastward across the
local area this evening ahead of a cold front. As the evening
progresses, the passage of the front will allow for VFR conditions
to become prevalent for the remainder of the period. Southwesterly
winds this evening will shift to northwesterly by the overnight 
hours in the wake of the front. /96

MESOSCALE UPDATE FOR SEVERE WEATHER...
A cold front oriented north to south continues moving east across
the area through the rest of the evening. Lack of strong dynamics
looks to continue inhibiting any strong storm development.
Additionally 700-500mb lapse rates are not supportive of robust 
updrafts, thus, despite modest recovery after early clouds and 
showers, the severe weather threat looks to be low. Overall, based
on how this event has played out thus far, the overall state of 
the main line should remain in a pretty steady state over the next
few hours. A very small tornado risk still does exist along the 
leading edge of the QLCS and Wilcox County in AL remains within 
the TORNADO WATCH currently out by SPC. Outside of this, the 
overall threat for any severe weather is virtually non-existent.

NEAR TERM...
(Now through Wednesday)
Issued at 327 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Current satellite imagery shows a closed low pressure aloft located 
in SE Missouri, within a negatively tilted shortwave trough. This 
system will continue to track off to the northeast into the Ohio 
River Valley overnight tonight and gradually weakens during this 
time. Our region remains within a southwest flow aloft through the 
late evening as this feature tracks off to the NE. Flow then becomes 
more west-southwest late tonight and into Wednesday as the shortwave 
trough quickly becomes absorbed into a parent longwave trough that 
encompasses much of the central CONUS. At the surface, current 
observations show an associated cold front located over southeast 
MS. This front will continue to move east across the area through 
tonight. Showers and storms continue to develop ahead of the frontal 
system with the main band of showers currently located along the 
Alabama River. Precip chances quickly diminish behind the front, and 
expecting conditions to be dry across the area by late tonight. As
for temps, lows tonight will be cooler and will range from the 
mid 40s well inland to the mid 50s at the immediate coast. Highs 
on Wednesday will range in the upper 60s well inland to low to mid
70s. A high risk of rip currents is expected through Wednesday.

SHORT TERM...
(Wednesday night through Friday night)
Issued at 327 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

An upper ridge will build along the Eastern Seaboard as the next 
closed upper low over the central rockies will initially dive
southeastward over the Southern Plains through Thursday evening
and then eastward. Surface high pressure centered over the 
Mississippi River Valley shifts east to near the East Coast, 
keeping the Southeast under dry northerly flow. With the dry 
airmass over the forecast area combined with an increase in upper 
subsidence from the upper ridging, temperatures see a bit of an 
upward trend through the period. Low temperatures in the mid to 
upper 40s (low 50s along the coast) Wednesday night rise to the 
upper 40s low 50s inland, mid to upper 50s along the coast 
Thursday night. Thursday's temperatures are expected to top out in
the low 70s northwest of I-65 to the upper 70s well southeast and
and along the I-10 corridor. /16 /22

LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Tuesday)
Issued at 327 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

The handling of the upper low has been consistent in the guidance
into Friday, with differences in track and speed in the weekend 
making for a less confident forecast thereafter. The latest 
guidance is advertising the upper low over the Southern Plains 
approaching the Mississippi River Friday through Friday night, 
then moving north along the west side of the river towards the 
Great Lakes, opening as it moves north. A surface low develops 
near the Tx Gulf coast early in the Extended, then moves it north 
with the upper low. A warm front organizes along the north-central 
and northeastern Gulf coast as flow over the Gulf becomes more 
southerly, with isentropic upglide setting up over the cooler 
airmass over the rain cooled land portions of the forecast area 
and nearby. With a modest 40kt 850mb jet setting up on the east 
side of the northward moving system (and over the forecast area), 
decent training of storms inland is possible in the latest 
guidance along and north of the warm front. By Sunday night, 
guidance is advertising drier air moving inland over western 
portions of the Southeast, with the rain moving off. Guidance has 
been inconsistent with the timing/path/strength of the upper low 
over the weekend, so have less confidence with the timing of the 
rain (mainly Friday night into Sunday) along with the strength of 
the upglide. Helping to temper any water issues is the most
affected portion of the forecast area, south of Highway 84, being
in moderate to severe drought. Will continue to monitor. One 
thing that has been consistent has been a downward trend in 
temperatures for the weekend, from around to a bit above Friday to
below seasonal norms by Sunday. /16 /22

MARINE...
Issued at 327 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Small craft exercise caution headlines will continue through 
tonight for all marines zones today due to a moderate to 
occasionally strong southerly flow. As a cold front moves through 
the marine area tonight, a northwesterly flow in the wake of the 
front looks to strengthen just enough to warrant a Small Craft 
Advisory over the open Gulf waters from mid evening through much 
of the night, with SCEC conditions continuing over the rest of the
marine areas. The offshore flow subsides on Wednesday, with a 
light easterly flow developing by Friday. Over the weekend another
system looks to move through bringing back moderate to 
occasionally strong onshore flow by Saturday which may eventually 
require small craft exercise caution headlines. JEH/88
