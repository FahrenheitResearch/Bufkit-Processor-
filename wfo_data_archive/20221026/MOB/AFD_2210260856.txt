.NEAR TERM...
(Now through Thursday)
Issued at 219 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

An upper low over the Midwest along with an upper level shortwave
trough off the East Coast move off, with an upper level ridge 
building over the East Coast and increasing upper subsidence for 
the Southeast. Surface high pressure west of the Mississippi River
shifts northeast to over the Great Lakes, easing the 
northwesterly to north flow over the Southeast, but drier, cooler 
air continues to filter south over the Southeast. The increasing 
upper subsidence combines with the dry airmass and clear skies to 
bring an increasing diurnal temperature range. Temperatures 
tonight are expected to bottom out in the mid 40s well northwest 
of the Tombigbee River to mid 50s well southeast of I-65. Clear 
skies will add good radiational cooling to the temperature 
equation, allowing temperatures to drop into the low 40s north of 
Highway 84, mid to upper 40s south and around 50 along the coast 
Wednesday night. High temperatures rise from today to Thursday. 
Upper 60s to around 70 north of Highway 84 to low to mid 70s along
the I-10 corridor are expected today, with around 70 to low 70s 
north of Highway 84 to the mid 70s south of I-65 expected 
Thursday.

A High Risk of rip currents will ease to a Low into tonight, but 
rises back to High for the weekend as onshore flow increases ahead 
of the next system approaches from the west. /16

.SHORT TERM...
(Thursday night through Friday night)
Issued at 219 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

An upper low will have formed over New Mexico by the beginning of
the period and continues somewhat slowly eastward across Texas
through Friday night. An associated surface low progresses across
Texas and reaches the Texas/Louisiana border late Friday night. A
warm front develops with the surface low, though this feature is
constrained to across the northeastern Gulf into Friday night due
to a large surface ridge over the eastern states. Dry conditions 
prevail over the area through Friday, then this pattern allows for
improving deep layer moisture and promotes an 
overrunning/isentropic flow which supports chance to good chance 
pops for most of the area Friday night. Lows Thursday night range
from the upper 40s well inland to the mid 50s at the coast, then 
Friday night will be milder with mid 50s well inland ranging to 
the lower/mid 60s at the coast. Highs on Friday will be mostly 75 
to 80. A low risk of rip currents Thursday night will be followed
by a moderate risk for Friday and Friday night. /29

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Tuesday)
Issued at 219 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The upper low over eastern Texas gradually breaks down to an open
wave through Sunday morning while lifting towards the 
Ohio/Mississippi River confluence. The associated surface low 
closely follows the upper system and brings the warm front 
northward through the area Saturday night into Sunday, though this
occurs as much drier deep layer air also flows into the forecast 
area. For Saturday, plenty of deep layer moisture will be in place
with a primarily overrunning flow pattern and have gone with 
likely to categorical pops. Despite a "warm sector" following in 
the wake of the warm frontal passage Saturday night into Sunday, 
the surge of much drier air has a progressively bigger impact on 
the coverage of precipitation. Instability looks to be generally 
limited through the period as despite the passage of the warm 
front, the drier air flowing into the area will be a pretty 
significant limiting factor. At this point, can't rule out some 
strong storms near the coast on Saturday then over the rest of the
area Saturday night, possibly into Sunday morning, but this is 
difficult to ascertain given uncertainties with the instability. For
Saturday night, will have chance to likely pops (highest over the
eastern half) followed by dry conditions developing over the 
western portion of the area on Sunday with chance pops further to 
the east. Will need to monitor for the potential of locally heavy
rainfall especially over the coastal counties on Saturday and into
Sunday night, though it is thought that fairly dry soil conditions
will mitigate to at least some degree the potential for flooding 
concerns. Dry conditions prevail Sunday night, and dry conditions 
follow for Monday and Tuesday. /29

.MARINE...
Issued at 219 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Moderate to strong offshore winds into the morning hours follow a
cold front passage. Winds will quickly settle today, but become a
moderate to strong northeast to easterly flow Wednesday night 
into Thursday as isentropic downglide increases on the southern 
side of surface high pressure passing north of the area. Light to 
at times moderate easterly flow Thursday into Thursday night is 
expected. Winds will shift to southeast to south and become 
moderate to strong Friday through the weekend as a system 
approaches from the west. Another cold front will move east over 
area waters Sunday into Sunday night, bringing light to at time 
moderate west to northwest winds to area waters after the front's 
passage. A Small Craft Advisory may be needed for the coming 
weekend. /16
