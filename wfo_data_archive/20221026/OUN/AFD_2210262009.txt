.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 302 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Breezy south winds and RH hovering near 25% will lead to continued 
elevated fire weather through late afternoon across portions of 
northwest Oklahoma before conditions improve as RH recovers this 
evening. Surface pressure falls will continue to our west tonight 
into tomorrow as a compact shortwave dives southeastward over the 
Rockies. This will maintain south-southeast surface winds over the 
area but moisture return looks meager overall coming so soon 
after our previous system pushed deeper moisture well to our 
south. 

Still, as the shortwave approaches tomorrow afternoon expect 
scattered showers and thunderstorms to develop with steep mid-level 
lapse rates leading to enough instability amid 40-50 knots of deep 
layer shear for a threat for a few strong to severe thunderstorms 
across western and southwestern portions of the area. The main 
hazards with the strongest storms would be some marginally severe 
hail and strong wind gusts.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through next Tuesday)
Issued at 302 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Instability will wane Thursday evening which should lead to an 
overall downward trend in thunderstorm intensity. Models continue to 
agree with tracking the upper low to the south of the Red River 
Thursday into Friday, keeping the highest precipitation chances 
across southwest and southern portions of the area through the day
on Friday. There still remains some uncertainty on rainfall 
amounts, especially on the northern edge of the system into 
central/northern Oklahoma, but as of now solutions seem to be 
converging on the heaviest totals (potentially greater than an 
inch) along/near the Red River with only light precipitation 
amounts for northern Oklahoma. Temperatures will remain cooler 
across the south on Friday, with many areas stuck in the low to 
mid 50s for highs, with low 60s further north. 

Models solutions diverge a bit more by Friday night into Saturday on 
the track and speed of the system as it exits to the east, with the 
potential for showers to linger into Saturday morning east if I-35 
if the slower solutions pan out. Regardless, we should see a 
general clearing trend by Saturday afternoon with temperatures 
back in the 60s for highs for much of the area. 

A gradual warming trend is then expected Sunday into early next 
week as south winds and sunny skies return, with highs reaching 
back into the 70s across the area. Another trough is forecast by 
most models to develop over the western US by the middle of next 
week. Impacts to our area would likely hold off until after this 
forecast period, but the synoptic pattern supports above normal 
temperatures continuing through at least the middle of next week.

(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1218 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Breezy south to southeast winds will continue through the
afternoon before diminishing at most sites with sunset. Parts of
western Oklahoma may see winds stay up through the night
(affecting KWWR and KCSM). Additionally, some low level wind shear
is expecting in northwest Oklahoma overnight into early morning.
Otherwise, VFR conditions will prevail.
