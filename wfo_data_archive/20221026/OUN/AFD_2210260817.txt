.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 317 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The Southern Plains will be between weather systems today as the 
next upper-level trough approaches the Four Corners region. Light 
and variable winds will become southerly as lee cyclogenesis 
occurs in response to the approaching trough. These southerly 
winds will become breezy across northwest Oklahoma this afternoon 
as the pressure gradient increases along with vertical mixing. 

Temperatures will be seasonable for late October with highs in 
the mid 60s to mid 70s deg F this afternoon and lows in the mid
40s deg F tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 317 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

By Thursday, the aforementioned trough will continue to dig into 
the Southern Plains and begin to evolve toward a closed-low. 
Synoptic-scale ascent ahead of the low will result in the chance 
for convection as early as Thursday afternoon across western and 
northern Oklahoma and western north Texas. Convective coverage 
should increase markedly during the evening and overnight hours 
as the low moves into the Texas panhandle. 

Elevated instability (MUCAPE ~450to 750 J/kg) will result in the 
potential for some thunderstorms across western north Texas and 
adjacent parts of Oklahoma. Effective bulk shear ~50 knots will 
provide an environment that may result in strong to perhaps 
severe thunderstorms.

The track of the upper-level low will take it just south of the 
Caprock as it starts to move due east across north Texas on 
Friday. As a result, the highest rainfall totals are forecast 
across west central, southwest, and southern Oklahoma and north 
Texas. 

Even so, there remains enough deterministic and ensemble spread on 
the exact track of the upper-level low and the northeast extent of 
the associated precipitation shield that probabilistic guidance 
gives more insight on the potential for rainfall. 

Here's the latest NBM probabilistic guidance (25th and 75th 
percentiles) on the potential rainfall for select cities in our 
area:

                 25th    75th
Oklahoma City    0.05"   1.02"
Wichita Falls    0.18"   1.77"
Lawton           0.17"   1.54" 
Clinton          0.16"   1.06"
Ponca City       0.00"   0.31" 
Stillwater       0.00"   0.52" 
Woodward         0.04"   0.47" 
Durant           0.13"   1.81"

As can be seen from this guidance, there is the potential that 
rainfall amounts could be quite a bit lower than the deterministic
forecast if the track of the low shifts south (i.e., the forecast
is highly sensitive to its eventual track). 

With the abundant cloud cover and rainfall, temperatures will be
quite cool on Friday across the southwest half of Oklahoma and 
north Texas. Highs in these areas will likely stay in the 50s deg 
F. 

As the closed-low departs to the east, wrap around showers may
persist into Saturday morning, especially across southeast/east 
central Oklahoma. Even if there isn't much rain, abundant wrap
around clouds appear likely.

The closed-low will begin to open up and lift toward the Great 
Lakes region Saturday night into Sunday, resulting in abundant 
sunshine and increasing temperatures in our area. Above-average 
temperatures are in the forecast as we end October and move into 
November.

VFR conditions are likely for the next 24 hours. Light winds will
veer around to southeasterly by morning and increase to 10 or more
mph as the pressure gradient tightens, particularly in northwest 
Oklahoma. High cloud cover is possible in northwest Oklahoma late
in the period.
