.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Wednesday)
Issued at 239 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Winds will continue to diminish through the afternoon and especially 
after sunset, and with clear skies and wet ground would not be 
surprised to see some patchy fog develop early Wednesday morning. 
This appears to be most likely across central into south-central OK 
where surface moisture will be highest. 

Winds will become southeast and increase during the afternoon on 
Wednesday as we see pressure falls to our west in response to the
next wave over the Rockies. Highs tomorrow will be slightly 
warmer than today for most, with mid 70s across our Texas counties
and upper 60s to near 70 for much of the rest of the area.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday night through next Monday)
Issued at 239 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Rain chances will increase late Thursday into Friday as another 
shortwave dives southward across the Rockies, closing off as it does 
so. Models are in agreement on this closed low taking more of a
southern track than the system from yesterday, which will lead to 
the highest rainfall totals and precipitation chances focused across 
our southern and southwestern zones, but at least some chance for 
precipitation will exist area-wide. Could see a few strong/severe 
thunderstorms out west Thursday evening, with an isolated threat for 
large hail or damaging wind gusts. Model spread then increases by 
later in the day on Friday regarding how quickly the system will 
exit the area, with some solutions lingering rain chances into 
Saturday across our eastern counties. 

Regardless, expect clearing skies by Sunday as the system lifts 
northeastward, with temperatures warming to near or slightly 
above average for this time of year as we head into early next week.

VFR conditions are likely for the next 24 hours. Light winds will
veer around to southeasterly by morning and increase to 10 or more
mph as the pressure gradient tightens, particularly in northwest 
Oklahoma. High cloud cover is possible in northwest Oklahoma late
in the period.
