.DISCUSSION...
Fairly quiet weather pattern shaping up for the next several days
as the jet stream will retreat to our north.

A system passing well to our north tonight will help generate
southwest winds as we get into Thursday. This in the combination
with the retreating jet stream should allow for a warming trend 
to commence.

After lows tonight in the 20s and 30s, highs are expected to be in
the 40s and 50s.

Dry and tranquil conditions continue through the weekend then a
cold front drops in from the NW on Monday (Halloween). Winds look
to kick up in response with a Lake Wind Advisory likely needed as
we draw closer.

An upper trough then looks to enter the picture at some point next
week, but timing and strength and thus precipitation cannot be 
determined at this time. TFJ
