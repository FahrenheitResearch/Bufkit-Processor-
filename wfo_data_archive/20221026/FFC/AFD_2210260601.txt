.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Wednesday)
Issued at 253 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

A deepening cutoff low continues to trek across the Lower MS 
Valley Region this aftn with a notable dry slot forming on the 
backside as the system occludes. At the sfc, an occluded front has
formed in addition to the cold front that extends south and east.
Showers and storms along and ahead of the front will continue to 
push east through the aftn. This will impact our area later this 
evening into the early overnight hours. Latest satellite imagery 
shows cloud cover starting to increase across the west in addition
to an developing Cu field. 

Portions of north and central GA remain in a marginal risk (1/5)
for severe storms tonight. Still thinking that the primary severe
threat will remain just to our west given the time of day and 
upper level support being displaced further north than really any 
available CAPE. Tightening pressure gradient out ahead of the
system and strengthening LLJ will result in damaging winds/gusts
being the primary hazard with any storms that develop tonight. In
addition, latest hi- res guidance does show a notable area of 
MUCAPE (100-300 J/kg) clipping portions of southwest GA later 
tonight despite the fast movement of this system. So will need to 
keep an eye on any storms that form in that area. Given that 
plenty of shear is in place, it won't take much CAPE to get storms
going across the west. 

Conditions will quickly improve across much of the area by
Wednesday morning. Though some low clouds may hang around across
the north (most likely north of the ATL metro) as there may be 
wrap around cloud cover from the upper level system as it lifts 
northeast. High temperatures Wednesday will be in the 60s across 
most of the area with temperatures in the 70s across the 
southeast.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday morning through next Monday)
Issued at 253 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

By Thursday, the frontal push has cleared the Atlantic coast, 
leaving behind a mild, dry airmass characteristic of early fall. 
Highs will be pleasant, in the 70s, with low dewpoints to boot 
(upper-40s to low-50s). The most impactful player for our sensible
weather into the weekend will be a strong, 1030+ mb surface high 
sliding into place across SE Canada on Friday, with enough oomph 
to kick off a classical CAD event. For now, expecting cloud cover 
to steadily increase beginning overnight Thursday into Friday, 
with broken to overcast skies likely to persist into next week. 
Flow looks to remain out of the east/northeast well into Sunday, 
sufficient to drop highs through the weekend into the 60s (just a 
few degrees below average) for the majority of north and central 
GA, with lower-70s possible across our far southern tier. 
Atmospheric moisture begins to increase late weekend thanks to 
increasingly southwesterly upper-flow ushering in moisture-rich 
air from across the Gulf -- as such, a few showers or periods of 
drizzle are possible in areas especially socked in to the wedge 
airmass (points east of Metro Atlanta to the GA/SC border). 

Our CAD event looks to come to an end on Monday, when a mid-level 
trough that had spent the weekend digging and deepening across 
central Texas begins to lift northeastward across the Midwest and 
into the Great Lakes. There remains some uncertainty among global 
models regarding the details of the passage of the attendant cold-
frontal boundary, as the Euro develops a stronger surface low with a 
pronounced dry slot directly upstream of the front, while the GFS 
supports a broader local maxima in moisture. At present, there is 
also a discrepancy in timing the FROPA, with the drier, faster Euro 
favoring Sunday morning to Monday morning, and the GFS favoring 
Sunday evening through Tuesday morning. Either way, the front itself 
looks to be rather ragged and amorphous once it passes the AL/GA 
state line (as they tend to be), so it remains to be seen how much 
organization is retained... though time of day will play a huge role 
in how much instability is realized. Will wait to see how 
consistency wiggles out over the next day or two before trying to 
dig into the details.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 141 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A line of SHRA ahead of an advancing cold front is stretching
across east and central Georgia, along an axis from roughly AHN to
MCN. This line has cleared the ATL metro area and will continue to
move eastward through the morning hours. Winds have begun to shift
to SW at 5-8 kts behind the cold front, and will continue to NW
before sunrise. Winds will furthermore increase to 7-10 kts during
the daytime with gusts up to 20 kts. Some cold air stratocu clouds
are possible on the backside of the front, warranting MVFR
ceilings during the early morning hours before scattering out
after 14-15Z.

//ATL Confidence...Avi Update...
Medium confidence on duration of MVFR ceilings.
High confidence on all other elements.
