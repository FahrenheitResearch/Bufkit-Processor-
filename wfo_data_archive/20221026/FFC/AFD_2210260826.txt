...Morning Area Forecast Discussion...

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 424 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

As the morning begins, a low pressure system is positioned over the 
Midwest and moving northeastward towards the eastern Great Lakes. A 
cold front extending southward from the surface low is currently 
stretching from roughly Athens to Macon, and moving eastward. 
Scattered to numerous showers are ongoing ahead of the front. 
Instability in the region ahead of the front has been nearly 
nonexistent through the morning, and no thunder is being observed as 
a result. With 0-1 km shear values of 25-30 kts in east Georgia, 
some broad rotation in showers will be possible, and any storms that 
are able to develop will need to be monitored. Precipitation chances 
will continue to diminish from west to east as the cold front 
continues to progress through the forecast area, coming to an end by 
mid-morning today.

As the low pressure system continues to retreat to the northeast, 
strong surface high pressure will set up over much of the eastern 
CONUS, which will serve to inhibit PoPs and keep weather benign 
throughout the remainder of the short term period. Cooler and drier 
northwesterly flow has begun to set up behind the front in portions 
of north and west Georgia, and will continue to spread across the 
area throughout the day today. High temperatures this afternoon will 
range from the low 60s across far north Georgia to the upper 70s in 
east-central Georgia. Low temperatures on Thursday will be back to 
normal values, in the mid 40s across the majority of north and 
central Georgia. On Thursday, the upper level flow will become 
southwesterly as an upper trough digs into the Southwest, which will 
promote a gradual moisture return. Meanwhile, the aforementioned 
surface high will move eastward, with the center moving into eastern 
Canada on Thursday afternoon, which will begin setting up a cold air 
damming event on the eastern side of the Appalachians as we 
transition to the extended period.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 424 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

As the closed off low sets up and moves eastward from the four 
corners region, a strong 1030+ high sets up over the NE into the 
weekend, giving us a CAD event into the weekend. AS mentioned in the 
previous discussion, cloud cover is expected to cover the area for 
much of the weekend causing temps to stay in the upper 60s to lower 
70s for the highs.

Models have been a bit all over the place with the next system 
coming through, but at this time they seem to be a bit more in 
agreement.  The closed off low is expected to lift northeastward 
into the mid MS valley, dragging along a front through the SE and 
into Georgia Sunday evening. As such, PoPs are elevated through 
much of the weekend, tapering off into monday evening. Max temps 
on Sunday have been lowered a bit into the upper 50s to low 70s 
from north to south Georgia. Instability is a bit all over the 
place at this time, so have chosen to cross that bridge when we 
get a little closer to the FROPA. Tuesday into Wednesday will see 
another dry airmass with temps only slightly warming a couple of 
degrees.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 141 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A line of SHRA ahead of an advancing cold front is stretching
across east and central Georgia, along an axis from roughly AHN to
MCN. This line has cleared the ATL metro area and will continue to
move eastward through the morning hours. Winds have begun to shift
to SW at 5-8 kts behind the cold front, and will continue to NW
before sunrise. Winds will furthermore increase to 7-10 kts during
the daytime with gusts up to 20 kts. Some cold air stratocu clouds
are possible on the backside of the front, warranting MVFR
ceilings during the early morning hours before scattering out
after 14-15Z.

//ATL Confidence...Avi Update...
Medium confidence on duration of MVFR ceilings.
High confidence on all other elements.
