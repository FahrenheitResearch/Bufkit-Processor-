...Afternoon Area Forecast Discussion...


.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 335 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Relatively benign weather pattern in place following the frontal 
passage last night with PWATs dropping under 0.5". Despite the drier 
air, most of which remains aloft, cooler air rushing in from the NW 
is keeping boundary layer RHs low enough for some low-level clouds 
in NW portions of the forecast area which have slowly eroded away 
through the morning and afternoon as dry air mixes downward from 
aloft. 

Winds will lighten overnight and turn toward the ENE as the surface 
high pressure behind the front becomes the dominant weather pattern 
over the eastern CONUS as it shift towards the Great Lakes region. 
As it does so, we'll stay locked in a steady weather pattern with 
gradual increases towards near-normal temperatures occurring as 
high temperatures tomorrow rebound into the low 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday morning through next Tuesday)
Issued at 335 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Beginning Fri morning the high pressure ridge centered over the New 
England states is setting up as a wedge down the eastern seaboard. 
This wedge continues to strengthen through Sat morning as the 
developing frontal system over eastern TX deepens and pushes east. 

Models seem 5to be coming into a bit better agreement with this next 
system but the ECMWF is still about 12 hours slower than the GFS.
The closed low is expected to lift northeastward into the mid MS 
valley, pushing a cold front through the Southeastern US and into 
Georgia Sat evening through Sunday. One thing the models agree on is 
the wedge strengthening ahead of this next system so it should help 
to keep things fairly stable across North and Central GA through the 
weekend. This will keep any storms that try to develop along the 
front fairly weak. The GFS is notorious for weakening and pulling a 
wedge out to fast and it is also showing it staying across the state 
through Mon morning. This gives a bit more confidence to keeping 
mainly showers with some isolated thunderstorms Sunday in the 
forecast. PoPs stay elevated Sat night, finally tapering off Monday 
evening. 

High temps through the period stay mainly in the 60s and 70s with 
Lows in the 50s and 50s.
