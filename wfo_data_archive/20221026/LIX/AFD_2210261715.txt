.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 355 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Negatively tilted upper trough continues to move northeastward
through the Ohio River Valley this morning. The next strong trough
is well to the west, moving onto the Pacific Coast this morning.
Yesterday's cold front is well to the east, near Fort Walton Beach
at 3 AM. Most of the local area is as much as 20 degrees cooler 
than 24 hours ago. Most locations are reporting temperatures in
the 50s, with the exception of areas downwind of Lake
Pontchartrain, where it's still in the 60s. Dew points generally
mid 40s to lower 50s, again about 20 degrees lower than this time
yesterday.

Upper flow is expected to remain zonal across the area today and
tonight before the Pacific Coast trough reaches the southern
Rockies tomorrow. This will cause the upper flow to become
southwesterly, and the surface flow easterly to southeasterly by 
late in the day tomorrow. 

Expect little or no cloud cover through the daytime hours
tomorrow, although a few cirrus can't be ruled out late in the day
tomorrow across the west. 

With dry air in place and cold advection relaxing, will trend
temperatures toward the warmer end of the guidance envelope, about
a degree or so above the NBM deterministic numbers for highs.
Overnight lows looked reasonable with the exception of the Pearl
and Pascagoula River basins being a few degrees too warm in the
NBM deterministics, and nudged those downward. The NBM 
deterministic dew points were about midway between the NAM and 
GFS MOS values today, which had about a 6-8F difference with NAM 
higher, opted to stay pretty close to the NBM.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 355 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The western trough that will be in the southern Rockies tomorrow
afternoon will move eastward on Friday across Texas before
tracking northeastward into northern Louisiana Saturday, the
confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers as it weakens by 
midday Sunday, and absorbed by a northern stream trough over the
Great Lakes on Monday. There are minor timing (maybe 6 hours or
so), strength and location differences between the global models,
with the exception of the UKMET, which tracks the surface low 
along Interstate 10 Saturday across our area. That is about 3 
degrees of latitude further south than the other models. For now, 
the NBM appears to be a decent compromise on timing, as it doesn't
appear to have a large contribution from the UKMET.

Precipitable water values near or below 0.50 inch today won't even
start to increase until Thursday night, and won't even reach 1
inch until midday Friday. Friday should see a gradual increase in
high clouds, with ceilings dropping to perhaps 700 mb (10,000
feet) late in the day. Rain chances will increase from the west by
sunset Friday, but forecast soundings won't be supportive of
thunder at that point.

Precipitable water values reach perhaps 1.5 inches on Friday night
into Saturday, but forecast soundings indicate that any threat of
surface based convection is pretty low. Can't rule out some
elevated convection late Friday night or Saturday morning before
drying upper levels preclude even that by late in the day
Saturday. Looks to be a decent opportunity for much needed
rainfall with this system, around 1-1.5 inches (with locally 
higher amounts), but nowhere near wiping out the rainfall deficit 
that we've accumulated over the last 6 weeks or so. Much of the 
area has seen less than 25 percent of normal rainfall over the 
past month, and yesterday's rainfall in most areas will likely 
evaporate today, if it hasn't already. 

With the upper system to the north on Sunday, cyclonic flow will
bring some low clouds to at least northern portions of the area,
but there's essentially no moisture above 800 mb, so significant
precipitation isn't in the picture at that point. Next southern
stream system doesn't look to impact the local area until midweek
next week. With current differences in the global solutions that
far out, will ride with the NBM numbers. 

Regarding temperatures, surprisingly little difference between
ECMWF/GFS/NBM deterministic numbers for most of the long term
period, no significant adjustments made to those.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1213 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A dry and very stable airmass will remain in place through
tomorrow. As a result, prevailing VFR conditions are expected at
all of the terminals. Continued cold air advection over the Lake
Pontchartrain will allow northeast winds to increase to 12 knots
or greater late tonight into early tomorrow morning. Otherwise,
no significant impacts to aviation operations are anticipated
through tomorrow afternoon. 

&&

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 550 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions through the period at all terminals. Northerly winds
at KNEW should gradually ease below 15 knots in the next couple 
hours. Could see a brief increase to 15 knots or higher again this
evening there as cold advection may not have completely shut off
by then. 

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 355 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Plan to allow the Small Craft Advisory to expire on schedule at
12z, and replace with Small Craft Exercise Caution headlines for
all waters through 18z as conditions slowly relax. Caution
headlines might be needed in the eastern waters late tonight
before the cold advection relaxes completely. A couple of quiet
days beyond that until the western system gets closer, and likely
necessitates more headlines Friday night into Saturday. Winds at
that time will turn onshore and increase to perhaps 20 knots on
Saturday before conditions relax again on Sunday.
