.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday night) 
Issued at 354 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022 
Closed upper level low is currently centered over AR/IL/TN and 
the cold front associated with this low and our thin line 
of...showers has moved out of our forecast area into Alabama. 
Winds have shifted to westerly, and some gusts were a bit on the 
strong side. New Orleans Intl had as much as 30 mph. While it will
remain a bit gusty today and tomorrow, not expecting needing a 
wind advisory since sustained winds should only be around 10 to 15
mph. By tomorrow, winds should be out of the north to northwest.

Otherwise, the forecast will be rather quiet with dry conditions
and clouds clearing out of the area this afternoon and evening. 
Low temperatures tonight will be in the mid 40s and there will be 
a slight warming trend through Friday. -BL

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Monday night) 
Issued at 354 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Model solutions have begun to come into better agreement today 
concerning the evolution of a strong shortwave trough axis and 
attendant surface low and front on Friday and Saturday.  All of the 
guidance is now in good agreement that a jet streak passing through 
Texas will allow the trough axis to take on a more negative tilt as 
it pushes into the Arklatex region Friday night into Saturday. At 
the base of this trough in a region of enhanced upper level forcing 
near the entrance region of the jet streak, a rapidly deepening 
surface low and strong front will form over eastern Texas by Friday 
afternoon and then quickly pull to the east and northeast Friday 
night into Saturday. A surge of deep layer moisture will advect in 
from the Gulf of Mexico on Friday as strong onshore flow forms in 
advance of the deepening trough axis and surface low.  Precipitable 
water values will increase from near 0.75 inches Friday morning to 
1.5 inches by Friday afternoon, and shower activity should begin to 
form due to the strong kinematic forcing in place by Friday 
afternoon over the western half of the CWA.  However, thermodynamic 
profiles will remain very limited due to continued weak mid-level 
lapse rates of around 5.5C/km, and thunderstorm activity is not 
expected throughout the day on Friday even as temperatures warm into 
the 70s.  

The low will surge to the northeast across the I-20 corridor and 
into the Tennessee Valley Friday night into Saturday morning.  As 
this occurs, a cold front will sweep eastward across the forecast 
area. Given the increased forecast confidence in the passage of this 
front Friday night into Saturday morning, have increased PoP values 
to between 50 and 70 percent for this time period.  Precipitable 
water value will peak in advance of the front with values rising to 
around 1.75 inches.  Sounding analysis shows that the lapse rates 
will be largely moist adiabatic and remain below 6.0C/km. This will 
greatly limit the amount of instability in place with CAPE expected 
to remain below 500J/KG.  As a result, only limited potential for 
thunderstorm development exists with the passage of the front late 
Friday night into Saturday morning.  Despite impressive shear 
values, the lack of deep convection will keep the risk of severe 
thunderstorm development suppressed over this time period.  

By Saturday afternoon and evening, a strong dry slot will feed into 
the area on the backside of the front and the southwest periphery of 
the upper level low.  Precipitable water values should plunge below 
an inch by the afternoon and any lingering PoP should clear the far 
eastern portions of the CWA by Saturday afternoon.  Strong negative 
vorticity advection and deep layer northwest flow will then dominate 
the forecast area on Sunday and Monday as a longwave trough axis 
lingers over the eastern half of the CONUS.  This pattern will bring 
clear skies, low humidities, and seasonably mild temperatures to the 
forecast area both Sunday and Monday.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1117 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

VFR conditions will prevail through the period as high pressure
builds into the area. Cold air advection will keep northwesterly
winds elevated through the remainder of the night at the 
terminals along the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain, but 
otherwise, generally expect light winds elsewhere. After sunrise,
expect winds in the 7 to 12 kt range for most of the terminals,
relaxing quickly around sunset.

.MARINE...
Issued at 354 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022
A colder and drier airmass advecting over the coastal waters 
tonight will keep winds elevated near 20 knots, and the small 
craft advisory will remain in place through early tomorrow 
morning. The wind field is expected to quickly diminish during the
day tomorrow as surface ridging builds in from the west, and 
these more benign conditions will linger into Friday morning as 
the high passes through the Gulf South. However, a deepening 
surface low in Texas Friday afternoon will increase the pressure 
gradient over the coastal waters and push easterly winds into the 
15 to 20 knot range. These stronger winds and resultant rougher 
seas will persist through Saturday night as the low pressure 
passes north of the coastal waters. High pressure will gradually 
settle in on Sunday and winds should slowly relax back to near 10 
knots by Sunday night. Seas will also slowly fall from 4 to 6 feet
to 2 to 4 feet over this time period.
