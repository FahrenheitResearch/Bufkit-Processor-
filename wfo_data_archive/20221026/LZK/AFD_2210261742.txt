.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday Night)
Issued at 252 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

To begin the period, high pressure is parked over the Natural State 
giving way to clear skies and drier conditions. This will be short 
lived as another system will affect the state moving into the long 
term period. Until then, expect cooler, more seasonable temperatures 
as high pressure controls the weather pattern through at least 
Thursday. Winds are also expected to remain gusty through this 
afternoon as the low pressure system, located in the Ohio Valley, 
continues to push further away from the state...decreasing the 
pressure gradient. 

Forecast high temperatures are expected to be in the mid 60s to 
lower 70s with overnight lows in the upper 30s to upper 40s through 
the period.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 252 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The long term fcst remains relatively unchanged, w/ another 
prolonged bout of widespread rainfall possible through a majority of 
the coming weekend. The PD begins w/ strong sfc high pressure in 
place over N/Ern US. Aloft, a positively tilted trof is expected to 
be moving across the Srn Cntrl US.   

Through the day Fri, the aforementioned upper trof is progged to 
translate E/wrd, approaching the Natural State,  pivoting to become 
more neutrally tilted, and in the process becoming somewhat detached 
from the mean flow. As the upper wave transitions into a semi-cutoff 
low, guidance continues to suggest the wave's phase speed slowing 
down dramatically, w/ the upper low/vorticity maximum slowly 
traversing across the FA over the course of the weekend. 

At the sfc, lee cyclonic flow should be in place over Ern TX, and wl 
become juxtapositioned w/ the upper wave as it approaches the FA. 
Fcst guidance continues to suggest this low wl arc S/wrd of the 
state, moving through the ARKLATEX region, keeping the Nrn portion 
of the low positioned over the FA. 

Sat and thru the remainder of the weekend, this pattern wl be 
conducive for another bout of widespread rain to the region, w/ 
abundant synoptic forcing for ascent invof the potent upper 
vorticity maxima, and low-lvl forcing from ascent invof the sfc low. 
Given the positions of features and the fcst airmasses, the severe 
threat remains relatively low w/ this system. Overall rainfall 
amounts through the weekend wl lkly see the greater 
accumulations...totals near one to two inches, and locally greater 
amounts...over the S/Ern half of the state, w/ lesser totals, one 
half to three quarters of an inch, or less, over the N/Wrn half of 
the state.

By Sun night, the semi-detached upper low looks to pivot N/wrd, 
allowing for the closed circulation/vorticity maxima to be re-
ingested into the mean flow. As the stacked sfc and upper lows 
depart to the N/E, PoPs should taper off from the west to northeast 
Sun afternoon and evening. Dry condns should prevail thru the 
remainder of the PD, w/ warming daily temps heading into the new 
work week as low-lvl flow becomes Srly once more.
