.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 159 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

H500 low will continue to work its way northeastward, away from
the state through the overnight hours. Associated cloud cover and
lingering precip will begin to clear and strong winds will 
subside as it departs. 

Drier and cooler air will be in place across the state through 
the short term period as sfc ridging builds across the Lower/Mid
MS Valley. Mostly clear sky conditions and below average
temperatures are expected through the period.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday Night through next Tuesday)
Issued at 159 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

The long term period begins with an upper level cyclone moving 
into the southern Plains region. The storm system will move 
eastward across TX towards the end of the week, and begin to move 
northeastward Sat, tracking across the state and exiting into MO 
and IL by late Sun. The system will bring another round of 
rainfall, beginning across western AR late Thurs/early Fri morning
and expanding across the state through Sun morning. Total 
forecast rainfall amounts look to be higher across southern AR 
with up to 1 inch for much of the southern half of the state, and 
less than one half inch across the northern half. 

The upper cyclone will weaken as it tracks NEward early next week, 
becoming an open SWT Sun as it moves into the Midwest region. Long 
term model solutions become less agreeable by next Mon, but the 
general pattern looks to bring SWerly flow across the region as we 
move into the middle of next week. This will increase temperatures 
to above normal by midweek. Increased moisture expected as well, 
ahead of the next approaching system, which could mean another round 
of rainfall towards the end of next week, though this will be beyond 
the current forecast period.
