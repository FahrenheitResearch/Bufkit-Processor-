Zonal flow aloft will become swrly through the period ahead of an
approaching H500 trough. At the sfc, high pressure will lift
northeastward and srly winds will usher in moist air. Temperatures
will warm a bit more on Thursday, but readings should still be
close to average. Clouds will begin to increase Friday afternoon 
and evening.

By Friday, the H500 trough will have deepened into a cyclone and
will be moving eastward across central TX. Ahead of this system

limited to W/SW portions of the state. Continued to leave out any

By late Friday, a storm system will be moving eastward across the 
south-central Plains. The system will start to track northeastward, 
entering the Midwest region late Sun. As the system moves across the 
southern U.S., rain chances will increase across portions of the 
state Fri through early Sun. The greatest rain chances will be 
across southern portions of the CWA Fri night through early Sat, and 
across central and eastern portions of the CWA Sat afternoon and Sat 
night. Rainfall totals over the weekend are forecast up to 2 inches 
across much of southern AR; 1 to 1.5 inches across west, central, 
and eastern AR; and less than half an inch across northern portions 
of the state. 

An upper ridge will shift across the region early next week, with 
surface high pressure expanding across the south/southeastern U.S. 
Southerly surface flow on the west side of the high circulation will 
return warmer air and moisture to the southern U.S. through the 
first part of next week. 

High temps will be in the lower 60s to upper 70s, with lows in the 
lower 40s to upper 40s through the period.
