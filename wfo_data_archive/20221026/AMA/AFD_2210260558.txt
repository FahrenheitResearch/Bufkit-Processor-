.SHORT TERM ...
(This evening through Wednesday night)
Issued at 227 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Light west surface winds today will turn to the south tonight.
Temperatures are recovering quite nicely today into the 60s.
Tonight, temperatures will drop to near freezing again across
portions of the northwest Panhandles. By tomorrow, the next 
system will begin to dig into the Pacific Northwest and Great 
Basin region. A weak disturbance in the southwesterly flow aloft 
will help lead to a lee low developing across southeast Colorado 
tomorrow afternoon. Breezy south winds will increase through the 
day with some mixing of the 30 to 40 knot 850mb winds to the 
surface. Temperatures will still warm into the 60s and potentially
lower 70s for some areas across the Panhandles. Elevated fire 
weather conditions are possible across the north central and 
northeast Panhandles where 48 hour rainfall totals were much lower
and ERCs remain in the 70th to 90th percentile. These fire 
weather conditions will mostly be wind driven as minimum relative 
humidity values are above 24 percent.

.LONG TERM ...
(Thursday through next Monday)
Issued at 227 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Overview:
Perhaps the highlight of the forecast is the chance for showers
and thunderstorms on Thursday in association with the passage of a
cold front. The front will lead to cooler temperatures on Friday
with areas potentially not getting above the 50s. Afternoon highs
thereafter should be in the 60s each day. Thursday night and
Friday night could see low temperatures get below freezing. 
Friday will also be on the breezy side behind the front across 
mainly the west/northwest.

Further Details:
On Thursday, models are suggesting we should start to see the
development of an H5 closed low over central parts of the Rockies.
The H5 low appears to get cut-off from the main flow and makes an
east to southeast progression through the Southern Plains. The
biggest concern with this next system is the difference between
the models. We have timing issues along with differences in some
of variables. We have models producing precipitation early
Thursday in the morning hours, versus other model output
suggesting much later in the afternoon/evening. This timing
difference is obviously a big issue with regards to other
variables. In other words, models do mostly agree on the 
precipitation chances but timing/coverage is the biggest 
uncertainty at this time. We are lacking instability at this time,
so thunderstorm activity might be limited given the lack of 
energy. Shear is somewhat high which is not too surprising given 
the frontal passage. The lack of instability is concerning for our
thunderstorm potential, and the severe potential for that matter.
Confidence at this time is low with regards to thunderstorm 
potential. In fact, forecast soundings are suggesting more of a 
tropical outlook through the column with PWATs around an inch. 
These values are well above the median and close to the daily max 
in some instances. The combination of the front and moist column 
could lead to another round of decent rainfall across the area. 
There are important difference and uncertainties in place, but 
rainfall amounts may be the bigger story Thursday/Thursday evening
and perhaps lingering into Friday. That said, we are not 
completely ruling out severe weather, but at this time this looks 
be to a low threat. 

Lastly, behind the front on Thursday night and perhaps again 
Friday night we could see areas get near or below freezing. We 
have officially "crossed off" some counties which have hit that 
hard killing freeze in the northwest. That said, some areas may 
get down or slightly below freezing these nights which can be a
problem for sensitive vegetation.

VFR conditions are expected to persist through the period. A few
high clouds may sneak into the northern Panhandles (near KGUY and
KDHT) this evening. Southerly winds will become gusty this
afternoon, with a few gusts around 30 knots possible before
sunset (especially at KGUY). After sunset the gusts should drop
off, but a low level jet will strengthen and could bring some
low level shear concern towards the very end of this cycle (again
favoring KGUY).
