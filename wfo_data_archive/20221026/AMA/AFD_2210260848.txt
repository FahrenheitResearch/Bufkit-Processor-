.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday night) 
Issued at 202 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Synopsis: Today will see mostly clear skies with highs around 65
to 70 degrees across the area. Southerly winds will become breezy
for a few hours this afternoon with gusts around 30 to 40 mph. The
next period of unsettled weather starts tomorrow as rain chances
increase through the day, peaking tomorrow night, then gradually
decreasing Friday. The southeast Texas Panhandle has the best
chances overall with decent probabilities for over half an inch by
Friday. This system also brings with it a possibility for severe
thunderstorms mainly Thursday evening between 7 PM and 12 AM.
Large hail seems like the most likely hazard, but damaging winds
can't be ruled out early in the evening. 

Details: The latest water vapor imagery depicts a sharp trough 
digging southeast across the Pacific Northwest coast. A lead wave
is moving through southern NV up into UT. At the surface, 
southerly winds have been on the light side as a weak surface 
trough/low is maintained over southeast CO. Temperatures as of 
0700z were in the upper 30s to upper 40s. As the 500mb zonal 
winds ramp up this afternoon in response to approaching lead wave,
lee troughing will deepen at the surface setting up a tight 
pressure gradient across the area. This will promote some breezy 
conditions for a few hours this afternoon with southerly winds. 
The fact that there is not much of a downslope component to the 
winds should keep temperatures topping out around 70. 

Tomorrow the main system from Pacific Northwest will dive south, 
ending up just north of the Four Corners by 12z Thursday (good 
agreement here in models/ensembles). A surface low will begin to 
form near the western combined Panhandles with southerly winds 
across the eastern half, a cold front in CO/KS, and westerly or 
southwesterly winds across the southwest Panhandles. Some mid
level PVA will be moving into the northwest zones which could 
spark some showers near the surface low early Thursday. However, 
low level moisture will be lacking until late Thursday when a 
narrow tongue of "just in time" gulf moisture is progged to 
arrive in the southeast and perhaps southern Texas Panhandle 
(along the east side of the surface low). The latest 26/00z HREF 
DESI shows almost a 60 percent chance for the dew point to reach 
45 degrees in the southeast by 00z Friday, and a 15% chance as 
far northwest as AMA. This quadrant of the low will also feature 
modest southeast surface winds and some semblance of a low level 
jet to aid in lift and theta-E advection going into the evening. 
Meanwhile, the 500mb low is progged to strengthen as it dives 
south. The latest models and ensemble guidance are in good 
agreement showing a ~560 dam closed low over southeast NM by 06z 
Friday. This will bring cold 500mb temperatures of around -18 to 
-20 C across the Panhandles between 00z and 06z, and where this 
overlaps the tongue of moisture east of the surface low is where a
potential severe weather threat could materialize. 

While there are model differences with the low level moisture 
field in terms of magnitude, the placement of the surface 
features are very similar. Since the NAM has been handling the 
most recent systems well (as far as moisture profiles go), it and 
the NAMNest are being leaned on here a bit more than the other 
models (due to known biases). The NAMNest shows a healthy area of 
storm activity developing in the southern half of the Texas 
Panhandle Thursday evening, and moving into an environment with 
mostly elevated CAPE (around 1200 to 1500 J/kg MUCAPE) and modest 
shear of 40 to 50 knots. This could certainly support some 
supercell activity before growing upscale into a broken line. 
Again, this is a "just in time" moisture type of situation, so 
there is potential for the moisture to not make it far enough 
north to support the higher CAPE values. Will need to watch the 
12z HREF DESI probs coming in later to see how things trend 
(especially considering the main system will be sampled better 
later this morning). The good news is that the NBM POE values show
70% plus for 0.25" QPF across the southeast Texas Panhandle with 
at least a 40% chance for areas as far west as Amarillo to Guymon.
The west is where probabilities really drop off due to lower 
moisture values. Showers should end from north to south Friday, 
with some lingering wrap around in the southeast into friday 
afternoon (hence the higher POE values). A cold front will move 
through behind the surface low Thursday night. It does not appear 
cold enough for winter precipitation on back side of system, but 
there are still a few ECS ensemble members producing snow so we 
can't write it off completely early Friday morning. Expect 
temperatures to be much cooler Thursday and Friday, with possible 
freeze conditions Friday night for portions of the area.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Tuesday) 
Issued at 202 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The long term is looking quiet as weak zonal flow takes over in
wake of Thurs/Fri system. This is due to the flow becoming split
with progressive flow across Canada and the northern plains and 
a weak trough crossing the Baja area into Mexico early next week.
The weak zonal flow over the area will promote warming 
temperatures (staying around normal) and mostly dry conditions. 
The next system of interest starts showing up in the ensemble 
means in the first few days of Nov. Things could get interesting 
then if models continue the trend of large deep strong trough 
across the intermountain west. Will be something to watch.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1247 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions are expected to persist through the period. A few
high clouds may sneak into the northern Panhandles (near KGUY and
KDHT) this evening. Southerly winds will become gusty this
afternoon, with a few gusts around 30 knots possible before
sunset (especially at KGUY). After sunset the gusts should drop
off, but a low level jet will strengthen and could bring some
low level shear concern towards the very end of this cycle (again
favoring KGUY).
