.SHORT TERM ...
(This evening through Thursday night)
Issued at 159 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Overview:
Still looking like an active day tomorrow across the southern
Plains with the Panhandles seeing a chance for thunderstorms and
rainfall amounts upwards around 0.25" to around 0.50". Some areas
may receive more rainfall depending on how some of the
uncertainties unfold. There is a chance for severe weather, but
certain variables are limiting confidence and may need to time out
correctly. Lastly, a front is anticipated to pass through the area
starting as early as Thursday morning. 

Further Details:
Zonal flow at 500mb today will transition to southwesterly flow
starting tonight as an approaching shortwave moves into the Four
Corners Region by tomorrow morning. This transition will involve
the H5 shortwave becoming cut-off from the main flow across
Canada. This low strengthens as it progresses southeast from the
Four Corners into Texas. The center of the low appears to go just
south of the Panhandles. The system has noticeably slowed down by
about 12 hours from previous model runs.

By tomorrow morning, lee cyclogenesis will lead to a surface
low/trough forming over the Panhandles/eastern New Mexico as early
as Thursday morning. The low should track south/southeast with an
associated cold front passing through in its wake. The front in 
addition to the surface low may serve as a focal point for showers 
and perhaps thunderstorms. Our thunderstorm chances have uncertainty 
as instability may be limited to the far southeast TX Panhandle where
higher dewpoints are expected. That said, the moisture may not time 
out well as it looks to come in later in the afternoon/evening. 
Dewpoints go from the low 40s in the southeast TX Panhandle around 
noon to around the low 50s by midnight. This appears to be a result 
of Gulf moisture getting wrapped around the surface low. Instability 
across the area is not impressive and very likely our limiting factor
for thunderstorms (and severe weather). The NAM--in typical fashion
--has higher values with MUCAPE around 500-1000 J/kg. The GFS and 
European are only indicating values around a couple hundred to as 
high as 500 J/kg. Lapse rates are not too impressive with values 
around 7 C/km in the mid levels (750mb-500mb). The shear is 
noteworthy, and this may allow for updraft maintenance with the low 
end instability scenarios. The southeast TX Panhandle has the best 
chance to see severe weather. This is also where the higher 
probabilities are for rainfall amounts with PWATS around an inch 
possible. That said, newer runs have come down on these probabilities
for rainfall. For example, probability of exceedance for 0.25" of 
rainfall was previously around 70% for the southeast TX Panhandle, 
but now those probabilities have dropped down to around 40% to 55% 
from the NBM. Uncertainties still exist, and we are likely to see 
more refinements to the forecast.

.LONG TERM ...
(Friday through next Tuesday)
Issued at 159 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Precip ending Friday then dry and warming through the early part
of next week.

By Friday the closed low looks to track south of the Panhandles
and shift eastward across northern TX. Wrap around moisture looks
to end from west to east through the day. The weekend should dry
out as flow becomes more zonal or slightly northwesterly. The next
trough looks to be on an approach for the early parts of next
week. Long range models are in quite a bit of disagreement yet
with the system, so monitoring trends will be important. Friday
looks to be the coolest day of the extended period in the post
frontal air mass. Temps should start climbing after that through
the early parts of next week. 

As a quick note on the Halloween forecast, the Panhandles are
currently looking dry with temps in the upper 50s to lower 60s
during the evening hours.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1214 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions are expected through this cycle. Breezy southerly
winds are expected ahead of an approaching front. There may be a 
wind shift at the end of this cycle, but that shift is more 
likely after this cycle. Conditions will start to deteriorate in 
subsequent TAFs behind this front. As the front edges into the
area, KGUY may see low level wind shear develop as a strong jet 
around 1000 feet develops with speeds around 50-60 knots.
Otherwise, high clouds will slowly increase through the
day/evening.
