The forecast remains on track this evening. No major changes are
planned.

.SHORT TERM...(This Evening through Wednesday Night)
Issued at 219 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Weak s/w ridging will form over the forecast area for tonight and 
Wednesday, leading to dry and seasonal conditions for that time 
period. A sfc high will settle over the region tonight, allowing for 
light winds. The light winds and mostly clear skies should lead to 
colder than model blend lows. Clouds will be on the increase late 
Wed/Wed night as upper trof exits the Rockies and moves towards the 
Central Plains. Soundings do look to modestly moisten up across 
eastern SD as mid level omega/lift spreads across eastern CWA Wed 
night into Thu. For now chance pops look appropriate, and QPF values 
look pretty low. Temperatures, overall, favor near normal through 
the next 36 hours.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 219 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

The majority of this period should remain rather quiet as our region 
is progged to remain under the influence of a fairly progressive 
pattern with low amplitude ridging late in the week through the 
upcoming weekend followed by more or less zonal flow until we get to 
the end of the period. The region may then begin to see some changes 
as an upper trough enters the US Pacific NW and Western Canada. The 
only opportunity for any pcpn will be the first half of Thursday as 
some weak energy moves through the region. That system looks to exit 
quickly east by the end of the day with dry conditions prevailing 
thereafter through early next week. Temperatures are likely to 
remain at or above seasonal normals for late October.
