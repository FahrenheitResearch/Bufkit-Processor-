Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Flagstaff AZ
900 PM MST Tue Oct 25 2022

.SYNOPSIS...Expect warmer temperatures through Wednesday, then a 
bit cooler Thursday and warming back up again heading into next 
weekend. Breezy southwest winds Wednesday turn northerly Thursday 
and then decreasing into the weekend.

&&

.DISCUSSION...High pressure over the area begins to collapse 
tonight as a series of s/wv troughs move through the Great Basin. 
This will culminate in the passage of a compact upper low over the 
Four Corners by early Thursday.

Temperatures this evening are running up to 10 degrees warmer than 
this time last night, due to a warmer day Tuesday and increased 
mixing overnight into Wednesday. We will make a few tweaks to the 
overnight MinT grids, mainly to adjust some of the lower elevations. 
Overall, the forecasted slightly warmer overnight lows look good.

Breezy conditions Wednesday, from the southwest, ahead of the 
aforementioned low, a bit cooler with northerly winds on Thursday. 
Expect a slight chance of showers in proximity to the upper low. No 
additional short term updates are planned.

&&

.AVIATION...For the 06Z TAF package...Expect VFR conditions for the 
24 hour TAF forecast period. Sfc winds light and variable overnight 
and then increasing to S-SW15-25KTS AFT 18Z-20Z Wednesday. Aviation 
discussion not updated for TAF amendments. 

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...A weather disturbance will approach northern 
Arizona on Wednesday delivering gusty southwest wind and otherwise

winds will shift to northerly, with just slight chance of showers 
over the Four Corners.
