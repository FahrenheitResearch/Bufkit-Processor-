...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, FIRE WEATHER...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 203 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Clouds and precipitation chances will quickly arrive for 
northwestern and northern New Mexico tonight as a disturbance and
associated cold front sweeps down from the Four Corners area. The
system will quickly move southeast through the state Thursday 
bringing a round of gusty winds for the southwest and Sacramento 
mountain ranges, valley rain and mountain snow for northern areas,
and possibly a few thunderstorms for the eastern plains. 
Tmeperatures will be cooler areawide Thursday behind the cold 
front. 

The system quickly moves into the Texas panhandle late 
Thursday night into Friday morning with some gusty northerly winds
possible for the eastern plains. This will set the stage for a 
dry Halloweeen weekend into early next week with temperatures 
slowly warming back up to near normal for late October into early
Novemeber.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday night)
Issued at 203 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Winds aloft continue to increase this afternoon ahead of a closed 
upper-level low over eastern ID. The increasing winds and high 
clouds ahead of the low will act to keep overnight temperatures from 
dropping as much as last night. Models continue to bring the low 
from northwest to southeast across NM on Thursday with the majority 
of the associated rain and snow over the northern Sangre de Cristo 
mountains, northeast highlands and along the high terrain along and 
near the CO border including Raton Pass. Issued a winter weather 
advisory for this zone given that the track of low center is a tad 
farther south than previously forecast which will allow the backdoor 
surge to move in faster and result in a longer period of upslope 
flow. The stronger winds on the southern periphery of the low will 
result in wind advisory speeds for a good portion of western and 
southern NM Thursday afternoon into the early evening. Models are in 
very good agreement that a wrap-around band of precipitation 
continues in far eastern NM Thursday night before the low drifts 
east of NM Friday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Tuesday)
Issued at 203 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Some lingering morning showers will be possible on the backside 
of the low pressure system for the eastern Plains Friday.
Northerly winds across the eastern plains should gradually 
subside throughout the day. Meanwhile, a shortwave ridge will move
into western and central New Mexico with mostly clear skies, 
light winds, and warmer temperatures compared to Thursday.
However, high temperatures will be about 5 to 15 degrees below 
average area wide.

A subtle shortwave trough embedded in northwest flow will slide 
down the Rockies and clip northern New Mexico on Saturday, but 
will provide little change in the sensible weather. A second 
shortwave trough with slide down the California coastline going 
into Halloween, but will have little to no moisture to work with 
and will provide nothing more than some high cirrus clouds. 
Temperatures will still remain just below normal for late October.

Changes will start to occur Tuesday as a longwave trough deepens
along the Pacific coast. Weak ridging will develop upstream over
New Mexico with a lee trough east of the Rocky Mountains resulting 
in some breezy conditions over the eastern plains. Beyond Tuesday,
there is still some considerable spread in how the global models
handle the evolution of the longwave trough in the Western U.S.
with the GFS having a deeper trough with precipitation chances 
arriving as early as Wednesday for northwest New Mexico. The Euro 
and Canadian have the trough not as deep and more progressive and 
thus have drier conditions. At this time, expect stronger winds 
mid to late next week due to stronger westerly flow setting up 
over the region.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1142 AM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Winds aloft will increase today and tonight ahead of an upper low
currently over ID. Breezy west to southwest winds with gusts of 
15 to 25kts this afternoon will be common this afternoon through 
around sunset. Upper low and associated cold front drops from 
northwest to southeast across NM Thursday with a wind shift to
northwesterly from late morning to early afternoon. Widespread
gusty northwest to north winds will follow the frontal passage.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 203 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Moderate to strong west winds will continue over ridgetops tonight 
as an upper low approaches from the northwest. Moderate to strong 
winds develop all areas Thursday along with scattered to numerous 
rain and snow showers. Several inches of accumulation are forecast 
mainly for the Sangre de Cristo mountains and far northeast 
highlands near Raton and Raton Pass. The low shifts east of NM 
Friday with dry weather expected Friday through early next week.
