.NEAR TERM...
(Through Wednesday)
Issued at 957 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

A broken line of low-topped showers and thunderstorms is making
its way across southeast Alabama and the FL Panhandle. The 00z TAE
sounding showed a strong inversion around 9,000 feet and some
low-level convective inhibition. This highlights the narrowness of
the axis of moisture and instability feeding the convection. 
Incoming convection will encounter an increasingly hostile 
environment and should at least not strengthen beyond what it is,
if not weaken.

The front will follow the convective line by a few hours, with a
shift to northwest and northerly winds spreading across the
forecast area late tonight and Wed morning. Skies will clear
rapidly, and the air mass will dry out again. Cooler air will
arrive over SE Alabama before sunrise, with temperatures dropping
from the muggy lower 70s into the cooler 50s overnight once the
front passes.

.SHORT TERM & LONG TERM...
(Wednesday night through Next Monday) 
Issued at 242 PM EDT Tue 
Oct 25 2022

By Wednesday evening, surface high pressure will be propagating
across the upper midwest into Michigan. This will primarily lead
to dry conditions returning to the region for a couple of days
ahead of the next upper level trough. Across the mid levels, a
vorticity maxima is forecast to eject equatorward into Texas by
Friday night, and will become cut-off from the main mid to upper
level jet stream. This will allow for the developing surface low
to slowly progress eastward across the northern Gulf states on
Saturday and Sunday. The biggest uncertainty at this time will be
is if the aforementioned surface high pressure, which is forecast
to settle across the northeast will be able to maintain its
influence across the region on Saturday to keep rainfall mainly
west of the area. This all hinges on the development and northward
propagation of the NHC outlooked tropical features that are 
forecast to progress northward in between the east coast of 
Florida and Bermuda. This tropical feature effectively stalls the
eastward propagation of the surface high pressure system, which in
turn stalls the mid level vorticity maxima and subsequent surface
low pressure system. This will greatly determine whether the
rainfall falls mostly on Saturday evening or on Sunday and Monday across
the area. Beyond Monday, surface high pressure is forecast to
settle back into the southeast. Temperatures will remain near
normal for this time of the year with highs in the upper 70s to
low 80s and lows in the mid to upper 50s and low 60s as the
airmass re-modifies.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 726 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

A cold front will push through the area tonight with a broken line
of showers and storms along it. MVFR conditions are possible ahead
of and along the front, with conditions improving to VFR in the
wake of the front.

.MARINE...
Issued at 957 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

There should be enough push of northerly winds overnight over the
western Panhandle waters behind the incoming cold front to support
a Small Craft Advisory.

From CWF synopsis...A cold front will pass across the waters 
overnight and on Wednesday morning, followed by a shift to fresh 
and strong northerly breezes. A broken line of thunderstorms will 
precede the front. Calmer winds and seas return by Thursday as 
high pressure settles over the Mid- Atlantic states. Another cold 
front will push into the region by the weekend, which may lead to 
cautionary conditions returning to all marine zones once again.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 242 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

An influx of moisture off the Gulf from southerly winds and 
increasing rain chances for late tonight into early Wednesday 
precludes fire concerns. The Tri-state area should be post-frontal 
by Wednesday afternoon with north to northwest winds in place. Drier 
conditions are expected by then, but minimum relative humidity 
values healthily remain above critical levels. Low dispersions are 
forecast, especially areawide on Thursday from light winds.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 242 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Rain chances across the area will increase later this evening and
overnight. Unfortunately for any fire weather concerns, rainfall
totals areawide will generally remain under a quarter inch
areawide. With much of the rainfall remaining convective, there
could be locally higher totals throughout the area. Given that
these totals are rather low, there are no flooding concerns at
this time. The next rainfall chance won't be until this weekend.
