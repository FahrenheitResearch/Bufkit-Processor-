.NEAR TERM...
(Through Thursday)
Issued at 219 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Surface high pressure will settle into the Great Lakes on 
Thursday, which coupled with brief ridge building across the 
Southeast will lead to subsidence aloft over the region across the
upper levels. This will subsequently lead to clear skies and dry 
conditions areawide on Thursday. With the cold front pushing 
through the area last night and this morning, cooler temperatures 
will not be noticeable until Thursday morning, as low temperatures
are forecast to fall into the mid 40s to low 50s areawide. High 
temperatures on Thursday will be near average, with temperatures 
climbing into the upper 70s to near 80 for some.

.SHORT AND LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 219 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

We will briefly be under the influence of upper-level ridging 
heading into the weekend before another trough makes its way east.
The shortwave trough will drop south into Texas and march 
eastward over the weekend, increasing our rain chances as the 
associated cold front draws closer; although, the trough is 
expected to lift north before it reaches our CWA. There is 
uncertainty regarding the timing and impacts of this system but, 
as of now, severe weather is not expected. PoPs begin to increase 
on Saturday ranging from 40-60% and decreases through the Sunday. 
The last of the system should push through early Monday with PoPs 
of around 30%.

After the front clears through, the rain chances go back down to 
near zero as upper level ridging will return following the cold 
front with dry northwesterly flow at the surface and southwesterly
flow aloft. Afternoon temperatures will range in the upper 
70s/low 80s and overnight temperatures will be in the 50s, warming
to the low-mid 60s around the I-75 corridor by mid-week.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 727 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The low-level air mass has undergone drying today at the
terminals. A little more drying overnight will keep clear skies in
place while preventing late night fog. Winds turn northeasterly on
Thursday afternoon. Enough moisture will return for fair weather
cumulus to develop.

.MARINE...
Issued at 219 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Fresh breezes of northerly/northwesterly flow will continue 
through tonight and calmer winds and seas are forecast to return 
by Thursday with northeasterly flow as high pressure settles over 
the Mid- Atlantic states. Another cold front will push into the 
region by the weekend, which may lead to cautionary to advisory 
conditions returning to all marine zones once again.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 219 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Dry conditions are expected Thursday through Friday night with 
another low pressure system bringing another chance for rain 
expected this weekend. Low dispersions are forecast, especially 
across the Florida Panhandle on Thursday from light winds.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 219 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Rainfall totals from today topped at around a quarter of an inch.
Beyond today, the next frontal passage and chances for rainfall 
will be this weekend. Rain totals for the next system look to be 
about half an inch during the weekend for our western counties 
with less amounts to the east.
