.NEAR TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 313 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Convection ongoing mainly in the Florida panhandle with the
associated cold front through southeast Alabama into the western
Florida panhandle. Expect a slow weakening trend in the convection
as inhibition and weaker flow is draped to its east. A few
lightning strikes are possible early this morning. As the front
moves by, winds will quickly change to the northwest with a few
gusts to 20 mph just behind the front. A few breezes could occur
through the day as well as cold air advection keeps highs mainly
in the 70s with perhaps closer to 80 degrees in the southeast
Florida Big Bend. High pressure sets up later today and lows
tonight will fall into the 40s with the exception of the low 50s
in the Florida Big Bend.

.SHORT AND LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday) 
Issued at 313 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Surface high pressure will be positioned across the Great Lakes
starting Thursday with ridging and dry conditions entrenched
through the southeast. High pressure will slide northeast as a
digging shortwave trough enters west Texas Friday and deepens a
surface low pressure area. This low will kick out towards the
ArkLaTex Saturday then towards the Midwest Sunday will beginning
to weaken. The associated cold front, though some uncertainty
exists, will swing through Saturday night into Sunday. A decent
chance of rain is forecast, for southeast Alabama and western 
Florida panhandle, with decreasing rain chances and amounts
further east as the dynamics quickly move northward. Dry
southwesterly flow will move in after the frontal passage as
shortwave ridging and surface high pressure build in.
