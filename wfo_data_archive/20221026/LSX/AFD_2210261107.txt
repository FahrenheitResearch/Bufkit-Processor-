Area Forecast Discussion...Updated Aviation

.SHORT TERM...  (Through Late Thursday Afternoon)
Issued at 252 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

As the surface low, that brought widespread rain to the forecast 
area yesterday, continues to lift northeast away from the region, 
the tight surface gradient associated with it will gradually weaken. 
Thus gusty north winds will diminish by midday. Otherwise, clouds 
will continue to exit the region from west to east early this 
morning. So as a surface ridge builds in, expect sunny skies today with
near normal temperatures in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

The surface ridge will slowly track to the east through Thursday, 
but winds will persist from the northeast to east through this 
period keeping temperatures near seasonable levels. Lows tonight 
will be in the mid 30s to low 40s and highs on Thursday will be in 
the upper 50s to low 60s.

.LONG TERM...  (Thursday Night through Tuesday)
Issued at 252 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

As the broad surface ridge slowly moves to the east, a system will 
move on shore over the Pacific Northwest and drop into the 4 Corners 
region by Thursday morning. Even though the flow aloft over the 
forecast area shifts to the southwest, temperatures will remain near 
seasonal norms through the weekend.

In the meantime, the latest ECMWF and GEFS ensembles are indicating 
that the upper level trough will be a bit slower in deepening/ 
cutting off over the Southern Plains late in the work week. 
Otherwise, an associated surface low will develop in the lee of the 
Rockies and advect low level moisture into the Central Plains/Lower 
MS Valley. As the surface low slowly lifts northeast into the region 
this weekend, there is not a lot of upper level support with it, 
thus expect a light qpf event south of the I-70 corridor, late in 
the day on Saturday and persist through Sunday evening. Latest 
NBM solution is bearing this out with lower POPs Saturday afternoon
now, then higher POPs Saturday night into Sunday. Still some 
uncertainty on timing, location and strength of the system.

Beyond the weekend, expect dry and warmer conditions for the first 
part of the work week.
