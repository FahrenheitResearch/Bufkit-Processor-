Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Burlington VT
119 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Near record warm and humid conditions will persist until 
Thursday morning when a cold front pushes eastward through the 
region. Scattered showers are expected Wednesday afternoon and 
evening, then sharply drier conditions arrive on Thursday. Rain 
chances drop to zero by Thursday night areawide with quiet 
weather continuing through Sunday. Dry air will support large 
swings in temperature from chilly morning lows to seasonably 
mild highs.

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH THURSDAY/...
As of 110 AM EDT Wednesday...No changes were needed with this
update. Maritime air continues to stream northward ahead of low
pressure currently centered well south of the 40N/70W
benchmark. ALthough radar returns are light, we are getting
surface observations reporting rain is falling in locations east
of the Greens. Still anticipate this activity will gradually
spread northward through the early morning hours. Otherwise,
temperatures will hold fairly close to current readings, which
are mainly in the mid 50s to mid 60s. The forecast has this all
covered, so no changes were made. 


Previous discussion...The southerly warm and moist flow regime 
we are in today will continue through tomorrow night as a strong
northwestern Atlantic ridge holds strong ahead of an amplified 
trough digging over the Mississippi Valley. Said trough will 
lift northeastward into northern New York tomorrow evening and 
drag a cold front through our region to end this stagnant 
pattern. The timing of the front during the nighttime hours and 
departure of rich moisture to the east keeps us from seeing 
larger impacts than just a wind shift and arrival of lower 
humidity air.

While we currently have a wedge of dry air aloft quashing cloud
cover, an invigoration of moisture will return from the 
southeast as a disorganized area of tropical low pressure gets 
pushed towards southern New England. Scattered showers will once
again move from south to north, but the low-level convergence 
between two areas of low pressure will help induce a relatively 
large area of precipitation. Rainfall amounts, while still 
mainly 0.25" or less, have trended upwards given the better 
surface convergence/lifting mechanism. Deeper moisture, by proxy
>80% relative humidity at 700 millibars, will overspread the 
region during the day from the south. Ingredients for downpours 
exists for the showers that move through the region. These 
include precipitable water greater than 200% of normal and some 
instability given the rich low level moisture and modest daytime
heating, upwards of 250 J/kg most unstable CAPE. Temperatures 
will be sensitive to increasing cloud cover, but will tend to be
warm once again reaching the mid 60s to low 70s areawide. 
Expect very mild nighttime conditions prior to the cold frontal 
passage late Wednesday night, as well, in the upper 50s to low 
60s in most locations.

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT/...
As of 318 PM EDT Tuesday...The aforementioned cold front will 
slide through the North Country during the morning hours with 
lingering rain chances rapidly coming to an end. Cooler and 
drier air will filter quickly into the region which will cause a
clash between decreasing cloud cover, increasing sunlight, and 
cold air advection. Temperatures are expected to warm a few 
degrees through the day but not much given the degree of cold 
air advection. Nevertheless, slightly above normal temperatures 
are expected Thursday afternoon. Gusty northwest winds up to 25 
mph will develop post-frontal but will quickly abate as the 
surface and boundary layer decouple close to sunset. With clear 
skies, decreasing winds, and cold air developing across the 
region, we should see a very good night for radiational cooling.
Another feature to note will be a 1036-1028 mb high that sets 
up just to the north of the International Border. This should 
allow for cold air drainage into the northern Champlain Valley 
with Burlington approaching it's potential first freeze of the 
fall season. Elsewhere, temperatures will be a good bit below 
normals with lows in the lower 20s to lower 30s expected.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
As of 318 PM EDT Tuesday...Strong surface high pressure will be
fully in control of out weather on Friday although weak 
shortwave energy aloft may yield some high clouds during the 
daylight hours. These clouds are expected to fizzle away during 
the evening hours with another cold night with good radiational 
cooling. The latest probabilistic NBM shows a higher probability
of freezing or colder temperatures at Burlington and the latest
forecast now reflects this. Elsewhere, temperatures comparable 
to those seen on Friday morning will again be observed. Seasonal
temperatures are expected Saturday through the first half of 
next week as we remain under the influence of the aforementioned
surface high before it begins to shift east on Monday/Tuesday. 
This should allow rain chance to begin creeping up on Monday and
increase into Tuesday as an upper level trough over the central
US helps to advect some modified Gulf of Mexico moisture up 
into the region.

.AVIATION /05Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Through 06Z Thursday...Currently a mix of MVFR/VFR across the
region, but with maritime moisture streaming into the area,
expect ceilings to gradually lower to MVFR from southeast to
northwest at all terminals by 15z Wednesday. These ceilings,
with local IFR in patchy fog/drizzle, will persist through much
of the rest of the day, with some improvement late in the TAF 
period as a frontal boundary crosses the region. Scattered
showers will affect all terminals through the period as well,
and briefly reduced visibility to 4-6SM will be possible in
heavier precipitation. Winds generally S/SW around 5 kt through
14z, then increasing to 5-10 kt during the day. These will
transition to W and eventually NW as the front moves through
late Wednesday evening. 

Outlook...

Thursday: Mainly VFR, with local MVFR possible. NO SIG WX.
Thursday Night: VFR. NO SIG WX.
Friday: VFR. NO SIG WX.
Friday Night: VFR. NO SIG WX.
Saturday: VFR. NO SIG WX.
Saturday Night: VFR. NO SIG WX.
Sunday: VFR. NO SIG WX.

1991. At KPBG, the standing record is 53, also in 1991.
