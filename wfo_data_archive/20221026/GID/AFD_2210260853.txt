AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Hastings NE
353 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.DISCUSSION...(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 306 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Key Messages:

* The best chance for precipitation across the area will be
  between tonight and Friday morning. Precipitation amounts 
  across the area are expected to be only 0.25" or less, however.

* Near critical fire weather conditions are possible this
  afternoon in our south and southwest.

Despite high pressure in place at the surface across the area,
upper level shortwave activity may provide the impetus for a few
showers to make their way northeast across the forecast area
today. This may end up being just an increase in cloud cover
and/or sprinkles, but elected to include a slight chance based on
CAM guidance. As this pushes off to the northeast, a surface low
over Colorado will gradually move southeast toward Oklahoma, while
an upper low pushes southeast across the Rockies tonight.

As this low moves into New Mexico and Texas it will begin to be
cutoff from the main flow, so the central Plains will not receive
nearly as much moisture as areas further south. However, an upper
trough will extend through the Plains region Thursday, bringing
the best chance of rain to our forecast area Thursday and into
Thursday evening. There are a couple of models that keep this
system around into Friday morning, but even worse, the GFS keeps 
nearly all of the precipitation well to the south leaving us 
nearly dry. For this forecast, decided to go with consensus with 
a moderately high chance of rain but low accumulations...most if 
not all of the area can expect to see 0.25" or less of rain from 
this system. Winds will be breezy but not really strong with this 
system...out of the southwest at 20 to 30 mph as the system moves 
through.

After Friday, while there are some signals in the long term model
guidance that indicate the possibility of another system late 
next week, this will be a dry forecast for now. Temperatures 
Friday through the weekend will top out in the 60s before 
potentially a brief warm up into the 70s early next week.

.AVIATION...(For the 06Z KGRI/KEAR TAFS through 06Z Thursday)
Issued at 1152 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Increasing mid and high clouds today as a low pressure system is
forecast to move out of the Rockies. The winds will generally be
light overnight as a SFC high is over the area. As the high slides
to the east expect the winds to become southeasterly.Late in the
TAF period a LLJ will setup over the TAF sites, so put in a
mention for LLWS near the end of the TAF period.
