...New Long Term... 

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 1254 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022/
/Today through Thursday/

A mostly quiet forecast is in store for the region as we await 
the next system and widespread rain chances are set to arrive 
Thursday night. 

After a pleasant and cool morning, highs this afternoon will top 
out in the upper 60s along the Red River and low to mid 70s 
elsewhere. Winds around 10 mph or less gradually veered 
southeasterly this morning and will remain out of the SE through 
tomorrow. Ahead of the upper low set to dig south from the Four 
Corners, expect a few passing high clouds overnight with lows 
slightly warmer than the previous night, dropping into the mid 40s
to low 50s.

Most activity during the day Thursday will remain well to the west
of the forecast area, but storm chances start to increase in the
late afternoon/early evening for those mainly west of U.S. 281 
and near/north of I-20. Ahead of the low pressure system, mid-
level cooling will promote steepening lapse rates, while an axis 
of better low- and mid-level moisture is also drawn northward. 
This will support the potential for isolated showers and storms in
the aformentioned area, with a low threat for strong to severe 
storms containing both large hail and damaging winds. The better 
rain/storm chances are set to arrive just outside of the short 
term period, and will be examined in the long term discussion 
below.

.LONG TERM... /NEW/
/Thursday Night through Wednesday/

A potent upper level low will close off at the base of a
progressive upper level trough Thursday and swing through Texas 
on Friday. Strong dynamic forcing ahead of the system will occur,
but it will be moving too quickly to allow for moderation of the 
surface airmass. In other words, rain and storms will begin before
the warm front can move through North Texas. The warm front may 
get as far north as the southwestern and southern counties Friday 
before the moist/unstable surface airmass is shoved back southeast.
We will have to watch the western zones for a marginal hail risk 
late Thursday night when a line of primarily elevated convection 
moves in from the west. The southwestern and southern zones 
(depending on warm frontal location) may have a slightly higher
damaging wind or brief tornado risk into midday Friday. Otherwise
MUCAPE values diminish from west to east over North Texas and the
line should assuredly be sub-severe by the time it reaches the 
I-35 corridor over North Texas. Still widespread rain is expected 
to impact all of the CWA by midday Friday. Behind the initial 
line of convection associated with the warm conveyor belt, 
additional wrap-around precipitation will develop as the core of 
the upper level low tracks over the region Friday afternoon into 
Saturday morning. QPF probabilities put almost all of North and 
Central Texas in a most likely range of 1 to 2 inches.

Temperatures will be cool on Friday due to the rain and cloud
cover as well as a reinforcing shot of cooler air when winds turn
from easterly to northerly. Highs will likely be in the morning
for most areas with temps dropping and holding in the 50s during 
the afternoon. Clearing should occur Saturday from west to east 
and temperatures will rebound into the 60s for highs with some 
late day sun. A steady moderating trend will continue into next 
week with seasonable temperatures and pleasant weather in between
upper level systems.

.AVIATION... /Issued 1254 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022/
/18Z TAFS/

VFR will prevail at all sites through the TAF period with winds
southeast winds 5 to 10 kts and a few passing high clouds
overnight and tomorrow morning.

Aviation concerns start to increase after 00Z Friday with the
arrival of the next storm system.
