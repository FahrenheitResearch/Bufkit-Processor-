.SHORT TERM... /NEW/
/Today through Thursday/

A mostly quiet forecast is in store for the region as we await 
the next system and widespread rain chances are set to arrive 
Thursday night. 

After a pleasant and cool morning, highs this afternoon will top 
out in the upper 60s along the Red River and low to mid 70s 
elsewhere. Winds around 10 mph or less gradually veered 
southeasterly this morning and will remain out of the SE through 
tomorrow. Ahead of the upper low set to dig south from the Four 
Corners, expect a few passing high clouds overnight with lows 
slightly warmer than the previous night, dropping into the mid 40s
to low 50s.

Most activity during the day Thursday will remain well to the west
of the forecast area, but storm chances start to increase in the
late afternoon/early evening for those mainly west of U.S. 281 
and near/north of I-20. Ahead of the low pressure system, mid-
level cooling will promote steepening lapse rates, while an axis 
of better low- and mid-level moisture is also drawn northward. 
This will support the potential for isolated showers and storms in
the aformentioned area, with a low threat for strong to severe 
storms containing both large hail and damaging winds. The better 
rain/storm chances are set to arrive just outside of the short 
term period, and will be examined in the long term discussion 
below.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 336 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022/
/Thursday Night through Tuesday/

As the upper low gets progressively closer to North Texas on 
Thursday night, increasing low and mid level isentropic ascent and
moisture advection will lead to a blossoming of convection during
the overnight hours. A fairly narrow axis of high PW air (1.2 to 
1.5", ~90th percentile for this time of year) will become co-
located with the strongest forcing for ascent west of I-35 around 
midnight Thursday night. Showers and a few thunderstorms should 
already be ongoing during this time across West Texas, but as the 
forcing for ascent becomes maximized within the plume of moisture,
convection should really increase in areal coverage during the 
overnight hours. This should mainly be in the form of convective 
rain showers, however, as the core of the upper low impinges on 
our western counties, a compact area of steep mid level lapse 
rates associated with the cold core will allow for elevated 
thunderstorms and an associated small hail risk through the late 
overnight hours into early Friday morning.

Meanwhile, a developing surface low will likely take shape and
deepen somewhere in Central Texas in the vicinity of our southern
counties (Lampasas/Bell) by early Friday morning. As it does, a 
well defined warm sector will become established with mid/upper 
50s dewpoints likely nosing into our southeastern counties through
midday. Most of the surface based instability will remain to the
southeast of our area and will thus limit the severe potential in
our area, but we'll have to watch the northward advancement of this
warm sector as low level wind fields will be highly sheared and
supportive of low level rotation and perhaps a few tornadoes.
Farther north, widespread rainfall will continue through much of
the day Friday in the form of elevated showers and a few
thunderstorms. With the upper low progged to track right over the
heart of our CWA on Friday, we'll maintain a steady supply of low
and mid level warm moist advection which will likely result in a
healthy dose of wrap around precipitation as the low moves
eastward. This will keep rain chances in the forecast through late
Friday night with precipitation finally ending across our eastern
counties Saturday morning. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 2
inches appear likely across a good portion of North and Central
Texas, although there will likely be narrow bands of heavier
amounts (3+"), especially just north of where the center of the 
mid level low tracks. This area will remain embedded within 
strong east-southeast low level flow and will have a tap to the 
best moisture with sustained ascent through the event. Right now, 
that favored area appears to be somewhere just south of the 
Metroplex (Hillsboro/Corsicana/Athens). Given that rainfall rates 
should be modest through the event and the system will remain 
progressive, the overall threat for flash flooding appears low at 
this time.

Rain will taper off early Saturday and skies will gradually clear
through the day with a cool day expected. Highs will remain in the
60s and steadily warm into early next week.

.AVIATION... /NEW/
/18Z TAFS/

VFR will prevail at all sites through the TAF period with winds
southeast winds 5 to 10 kts and a few passing high clouds
overnight and tomorrow morning.

Aviation concerns start to increase after 00Z Friday with the
arrival of the next storm system.
