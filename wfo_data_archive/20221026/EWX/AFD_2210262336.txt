.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Thursday night)
Issued at 144 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Synopsis/Mesoanalysis: Southeasterly surface flow continues to 
establish itself across the region early this afternoon along the 
back side of a departing ridge axis. The bulk of the short term 
forecast resides in the evolution of a mid-level impulse currently 
evident over far southern Idaho. The feature is forecast to drive 
east-southeast into the Four Corners Region through tomorrow 
morning, ultimately reaching the front range of the New Mexico Rocky 
Mountains and West Texas tomorrow night/early Friday morning. 
Attendant surface cyclogenesis will occur along lee troughing in the 
TX/OK Panhandle vicinity as this occurs, with the infant surface low 
tracking into West Texas and the Red River Valley through tomorrow 
night. The cold front connected to said low will swing through the 
Big Bend and Lower Trans Pecos tomorrow night, ultimately impinging 
upon our far western Rio Grande Plains and southern Edwards Plateau 
counties by sunrise Friday morning. 

Tonight: Expect lows to be a touch milder with surface flow 
continuing out of the southeast. Minimum readings in the low-mid 50s 
are a good bet areawide, though locations within Hill Country will 
likely fall into the upper 40s prior to daybreak tomorrow. With 
moisture funneling up the Rio Grande Valley, expect some low clouds 
to build in to our far western communities near or just after 
sunrise.

Tomorrow: Conditions should be a touch muggier as dew points 
continue to recover. Skies should remain mostly clear to the east of 
US 281, with scattered clouds lingering further west. Highs should 
top out in the upper 70s and low 80s in most locations. The lone 
exception will likely be in the southern Edwards Plateau, where 
stubborn clouds should hold temperatures in the low to mid 70s.

Tomorrow Night: Conditions should stay quiet through the midnight 
hour. This will change moving into the predawn hours Friday morning 
as the aforementioned cold front begins to approach the region from 
the northwest. Morning CAM guidance has trended noticeably slower 
with the feature, suggesting that the boundary should be somewhere 
over the southern Edwards Plateau/Rio Grande Plains by 12Z 
Friday/the end of the short term. Discussion of along front 
convection and its affiliated hazards is thus deferred to the long 
term forecast below. Of relevance to the short term is the potential 
for pre-frontal showers and thunderstorms between 06 and 12Z Friday 
morning. Connected to nocturnal moisture advection and southerly low-
level flow, the suite of 12Z high-res guidance depicts the 
development of streamer-type showers across the region following 
midnight. Likely connected to the arrival of the left exit region of 
a jetlet swinging through the base of the mid-upper level 
disturbance, several members depict intensification of some of this 
activity nearing daybreak on Friday. Much uncertainty remains 
regarding the character of this potential convection, namely if it 
will be able to root to the surface given the presence of a shallow 
inversion in the boundary layer. If a storm can deepen and become 
surface-based, backed southeasterly surface winds and 
elongated/veering hodographs in the lowest kilometer would support 
an isolated tornado threat in any predawn activity, particularly 
across the southern Edwards Plateau, Rio Grande Plains, and Winter 
Garden where inhibition is forecast to be the weakest. Isolated 
damaging winds in excess of 60 MPH and large hail exceeding quarter 
size will be possible as well. The Storm Prediction Center has 
shifted its Day 2 marginal risk further east in light of this 
potential. We will continue to monitor this portion of the short 
term period accordingly.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 144 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The long term period starts out active as a Pacific cold front
advances through South-Central Texas. A surface low over north Texas
will slide southeastward through the Coastal Plains, and lift over
central Louisiana by Saturday morning. Ongoing convection is expected
along this frontal boundary Friday morning, and could potentially
impact the morning commute along the I-35 corridor, but timing is the
main item to nail down at this point. Additionally, strong to severe
storms are possible along the boundary, especially with any storms
that can become attached to the boundary, where they could take
considerable advantage of significant low level shear and backing
winds below 1km. At this time, SPC currently has just the Coastal
Plains in a Day 3 Marginal risk, but that may be pushed further west
to include the I-35 corridor in a future outlook. The primary
concerns will be damaging winds, given some mid-level drying and
strong dynamics in the right entrance region of a 200mb jet streak.
Additionally, the threat for isolated tornadoes along the front will
be there, given ample 0-3km SRH and impressive forecast hodographs
for this time of year. The main limiting factor appears to be
instability, but if the front continues to slow down in timing, that
may become less of an issue for Friday morning. Obviously, we will
continue to monitor that trend.

Breezy and even gusty northwesterly winds can be expected behind the
departing surface low Friday night and into Saturday. Temperatures
will be notably cooler, most likely in the 60s for many on Friday
afternoon and again on Saturday with locations generally along and
south of I-10 in the lower 70s. As a surface high slides east Sunday,
expect return flow to begin with southeasterly surface winds and
temperatures climbing back into the upper 70s. Moisture return will
remain modest at best though, with surface dewpoints in the upper 40s
to middle 50s Sunday and Monday. Trick or Treating weather looks
pleasant, but perhaps a bit on the warm side early on, before cooling
off quickly after sunset into the 60s.

Beyond Monday, the forecast becomes considerably more difficult,
given lower agreement between global models. After collaborating with
neighboring offices, have opted to stick with the NBM and hope for
further/better model agreement on our next potential rainmaker
arriving sometime Tuesday-Wednesday. At present, the GFS is the
outlier, but even its ensembles are fairly bullish on a widespread
soaking rain event. For now, will stick with a dry forecast, but that
will probably change in the coming days.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 622 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions are expected for the I-35 sites through the forecast
period. A light southeast wind flow is expected to dominate through
late Thursday morning. The wind picks up to 8-12 knots with occasional
gusts up to 19 knots in the afternoon. For KDRT, VFR conditions are 
forecast through Thursday morning. MVFR cigs are anticipated around 
14z Thursday. VFR cigs return by 18z Thursday with a southeasterly 
wind flow around 10 to 12 knots and gusting up to 22 knots in the 
afternoon. A cold front is forecast to push across the Rio Grande 
including KDRT during the overnight hours late Thursday night into 
Friday morning. Showers and storms are expected ahead of the boundary
and some could impact KDRT. More details on the next set of TAFs.
