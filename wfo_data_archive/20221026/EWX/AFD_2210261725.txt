...New AVIATION...

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 244 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Current surface observations show high pressure intact across east 
Texas, with a lee-side trough across the plains of eastern New 
Mexico into west Texas. Early morning temperatures range from the 
lower 30s to the lower 50s. 

Surface high pressure continues to slowly build across east Texas 
while the lee-side trough strengthens. This will bring a return of 
east to southeasterly winds to south central Texas, with gusty 
conditions in store from late morning into the afternoon for the 
southern Edwards Plateau and Rio Grande plains. Plenty of sunshine 
will allow highs to warm into the lower 70s to lower 80s. Southeast 
to east winds remain intact tonight with a gradual uptick in low-
level moisture in store, especially out west along the Rio Grande. 
The increase in low-level moisture will allow for some low cloud 
development along the Rio Grande shortly after sunrise Thursday. Low-
level moisture will slowly increase throughout the day on Thursday 
as highs once again peak in the lower 70s to lower 80s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 244 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

An active start to the long term period is expected as a stacked low
pressure system and its associated cold front moves into the region
from the northwest.

This system has many similarities to the previous one that just came
through, however moisture levels will not be quite as high since the
atmosphere will not have much time to recover. Dewpoints are only
expected to reach the upper 50s to low 60s ahead of the front, though
ample shear and falling heights/cooling temperatures aloft will
likely compensate enough to result in at least a few strong to severe
storms along the front as it passes through. All modes of severe 
weather appear possible, though damaging wind gusts will be the most likely.
As of now, the main window for showers and storms appears to be 
early Friday morning with activity pushing completely east of the CWA
by sometime Friday afternoon. This activity will once again be 
fairly quick-moving so QPF totals are not expected to be too high, 
with generally an inch or less expected for most locations.

Since the upper level low will be cutoff from the mean flow across
the northern CONUS, the system is expected to slow once the front
moves through south-central TX which will result in breezy conditions
and cooler temperatures hanging around through the day Saturday. A
gradual warming trend to slightly above normal temperatures can then
be expected through the remainder of the short term as the closed low
eventually gets absorbed back into the mean flow to the north and
upper level flow across TX becomes more zonal.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1218 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Mostly clear skies and VFR conditions will prevail through the period
at the I-35 terminals. Winds should continue to turn from the east to
the southeast at all fields, helping to bring moisture from the Gulf
of Mexico back into the region. Gusts could approach and occasionally
exceed 20 MPH during the afternoon hours, particularly at DRT. Cig 
reductions are possible from mid-morning through the early afternoon
hours tomorrow at DRT, and have been accounted for in the 18Z 
update.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 244 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Gusty winds from mid-morning into the afternoon hours can be 
expected across the Rio Grande plains and southern Edwards Plateau 
today. With shallow moisture and mixing, we will see some afternoon 
humidity levels drop into the 20 to 25% range as gusty south to 
southeast winds continue. With forecast fire danger in the moderate 
to high category, we will go with a Rangeland Fire Danger Statement 
for the southern Edwards Plateau and Rio Grande plains today. 
Elsewhere across south central Texas, similar minimum afternoon 
humidity levels in the 20-25% range are in store, but wind speeds 
should remain lower.
