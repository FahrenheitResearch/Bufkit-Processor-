.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Wednesday night)
Issued at 145 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Pleasant weather across South-Central Texas today with seasonable 
afternoon temperatures and low humidity as surface high pressure 
slides atop the region. The north-northwesterly winds should also 
continue to subside through the afternoon and into this evening 
before becoming light and variable. With the clear skies and the 
light winds, radiational cooling will allow for a cool night with 
overnight lows into the 40s and low 50s with some of the cooler 
valley locations perhaps dipping into the upper 30s. Another nice 
day will be in store on Wednesday with afternoon highs into the 
upper 70s and low 80s. With surface high pressure sliding towards 
the east, a light southeasterly flow returns Wednesday afternoon. 
Not quite as cool from Wednesday night into Thursday morning with 
the southeasterly flow but the cooler valley locations still are 
expected to start off Thursday in the mid 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 225 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

An active/progressive upper level pattern is expected to continue
into through the final week of October. On Thursday, signs of change
will already be noted as west-southwesterly flow aloft brings in
mid-level Pacific moisture in the form of high cirrus clouds. At the
surface, southerly flow off the Gulf of Mexico will bring dewpoints
back into the mid to upper 50s and lower 60s by Thursday evening. By
late Thursday evening, a sfc low will develop over the southern Texas
Panhandle and then progress eastward through the night into Friday
morning. A surface cold front will swing through South-Central Texas,
with scattered thunderstorms, some strong to severe possible Friday
morning before quickly racing south and east towards east Texas
Friday afternoon and evening.

As of right now, the SPC has a Day 3 Marginal Risk for portions of
the Southern Edwards Plateau and Hill Country, but I would expect
that to be extended further east with subsequent outlooks and perhaps
be upgraded to a Slight Risk depending on the timing of the front.
Model forecast hodographs indicate sufficient low level shear, backed
surface winds, modest mid-level wind fields, and fairly steep low-
level lapse rates. The one limiting factor may be instability, given
the time of day, but even a with low CAPE, sounding profiles and
hodographs look rather favorable for some low level rotation and
perhaps a few tornadoes. Storms should quickly move east and likely
be out of the CWA by 20Z, with all severe hazards possible.

Beyond Friday, expect breezy and even somewhat gusty winds Friday
afternoon in the wake of the cold front, along with drier air
filtering in. A beautiful weekend should take shape with temperatures
in the lower 70s on Saturday, followed by a slow warming trend Sunday
into Halloween Monday. Temperatures should climb into the lower to
middle 80s by Tuesday of next week along with tranquil weather.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1233 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions are in store at area TAF sites through the current
forecast period. Light and variable or light easterly winds (at DRT)
will continue into the late morning hours. Winds will then trend to a
more southeasterly direction for the afternoon hours and will be
gusty out west at DRT.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 210 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions are expected to
continue for portions of the Hill Country, I-35 Corridor, and Coastal
Plains through early this evening before northwesterly surface winds
begin to relax.

On Wednesday, elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions can
be expected once again, especially over the Rio Grande Plains and
Southern Edwards Plateau, southward into the Winter Garden region.
Southeasterly winds of 10-20 mph with gusts to 20+ at times are
possible in these areas Wednesday afternoon, and in combination with
forecast fuel dryness values in the moderate to high category and RH
values of 15-25%, fire concerns will be present. A Rangeland Fire
Danger Statement may be needed for these areas Wednesday afternoon.
Beyond that, expect increasing moisture ahead of our next cold front
slated to arrive Thursday night into Friday morning, and fire weather
concerns should diminish through the weekend.
