...New AVIATION...

.UPDATE...
Issued at 1227 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Low-level trough across the region is resulting in widespread
cloud cover beneath an inversion this afternoon and evening. This
will help to keep temperatures cooler this afternoon along with  
northerly flow and CAA behind the departing cold front. We should
begin to clear out late tonight and into Thursday with a return of
sunshine and moderating temperatures as ridging makes a return.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 330 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Key Messages:

1. Expect dry conditions and below normal temperatures through the 
short term.

Discussion:

An upper low was situated over southern Ohio early this morning, and 
will lift northeast into the eastern Great Lakes region by this 
afternoon. At the surface, a cold front associated with this upper 
low was pushing into the TN valley early this morning and will shift 
east into the Appalachians by daybreak or so. By this afternoon, 
zonal flow aloft will be spreading across the southern Appalachians, 
with surface high pressure over the upper midwest building southeast 
into the region. As such, aside from a few lingering showers with 
the cold front early this morning, dry conditions are expected 
through the short term.

A wind advisory remains in place across the east TN mountains 
through 800 AM EDT this morning. Still had some gusts to around 50 
mph at Cove Mountain as of 2 am, and the cold front hasn't quite 
pushed through yet, so plan to let the advisory go until 8 AM. 
Otherwise, expect highs in the upper 50s to low 60s today with 
mostly cloudy conditions early on and perhaps a few sun breaks by 
late in the afternoon.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 330 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Key Message:

Chances for widespread rain return this weekend and early next 
week.

Discussion:

Thursday opens with WSWly zonal flow at 500MB across the eastern two-
thirds of the nation, and a trough over the Rockies. The trough will 
close off Thurs afternoon and slowly lumber its way across Texas on 
Friday, then head northeastward Saturday and open up again. This 
feature will induce southerly fetch in the low to mid levels that 
will increase moisture over the area, finally resulting in an area 
of showers, particularly on Sunday, that will progress across our 
forecast area from the southern Plateau first...up through SW VA 
during the course of the day.

The NBM remains seemingly fast with the precip onset, which I 
suspect will hold off until Saturday night, but we will carry 
gradual appearance of 20-30 % POPs during the day Saturday for 
consistency.

Still not expecting heavy rain, but latest Sat-Mon event total QPFs 
are closing in on 0.5-1.0 inch range, which would be useful.

Daily average temperatures will run roughly 3-6 degrees above normal 
through much of the extended period.
