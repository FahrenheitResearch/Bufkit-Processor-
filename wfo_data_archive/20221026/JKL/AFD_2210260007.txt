AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
National Weather Service Jackson KY
807 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

.UPDATE...
Issued at 750 PM EDT TUE OCT 25 2022

Hourly grids were freshened up based on recent observations. An
area of showers near and west of I-75 is gradually working into 
eastern KY. A moisture gradient remains in place across the area 
with downslope winds leading to dewpoints in the 30s over the Big 
Sandy Region and in the higher elevations near the VA border to 
the 40s to near 50. Dewpoints are in the upper 50s over portions 
of Wayne County. As the activity spreads east this evening, 
it will take longer for measurable rain to reach the ground.

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Wednesday night)
Issued at 414 PM EDT TUE OCT 25 2022

Increasing high cloud coverage has been the trend thus far, with 
winds generally out of the south between 5-10 mph and periodical 
gusts near 25 mph. This has allowed for temperatures to climb into 
the mid to upper 70s this afternoon. Dew points have started to 
climb as well, with mid 50s across the Cumberland Valley and mid 40s 
in the far east.  

Overall, guidance is in good agreement through the short term, with 
amplified flow across the eastern half of the CONUS. A closed low 
sits across the Ozarks, where another sits across Eastern Manitoba. 
At the surface, a cold front runs through the Midwest to the 
occluding low, where it continues south through the Lower 
Mississippi Valley. This will continue to press eastward, as the low 
is expected to meander just north of the area- through the Ohio 
Valley and into the Lower Great Lakes. 1930z composite depicts a 
line of showers and a few storms working through Western KY and 
West TN. This will shift eastward through the evening, with the 
best activity expected overnight along and ahead of the front. 
CAMs suggest the line of showers and minimal thunderstorms to 
weaken eastward, where the better focus for activity will be along
our northern fringes and into Ohio and north- nearer to the low. 
Soundings largely lack much instability, with any hints all 
elevated, so have omitted the mention. A weakening LLJ will also 
accompany the approaching system, which could lead to breezy 
southerly winds overnight, with the high terrain seeing gusts up 
to 25 to 30 kts. 

Fropa will come into Wednesday morning, where low cloud cover will 
linger through much of the day on westerly to northwesterly flow. As 
a result, have nudged highs down a bit cooler given the coverage, 
where mid 50s is generally anticipated. Heights will gradually
rise through the day as we are wedged between the exiting trough,
and a digging low across the Rockies. High pressure at the 
surface will shift through the Midwest and into the Great Lakes 
through the end of the period, where gradually clearing skies find
the area into Thursday morning. Lows tonight will be uniform 
given the coverage and rainfall, with lows in the upper 40s to low
50s. Wednesday night will feature upper 30s in the Bluegrass and 
western valleys, with mid 40s in the east where cloud cover 
lingers.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 400 PM EDT TUE OCT 25 2022

Key Messages:

* Dry to start the period with below normal temperatures increasing 
  to around normal fro Friday and Saturday.

* A system approaches the area late in the week and into the weekend 
  and will likely bring light rain to all of eastern Kentucky. 
  Timing is still widely variable across model solutions.

Global models start out in good agreement aloft to begin the long 
term period. A stout trough will sit across the Rockies with a deep 
upper level low near the Four Corners region. The trough and low 
will dip to the southeast Friday and into the weekend. This will 
support a surface low over south-central Texas along with its 
associated frontal boundaries. Moving into the weekend, the surface 
low will stay to the south and move through the southern Mississippi 
Valley while the trough begins to lift slowly to the northeast 
through the central Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. The NBM and 
Global model solutions begin to diverge Saturday and Sunday. The NBM 
is bullish as it tries to bring precipitation into the southwest 
Saturday morning while the Global model consensus is to bring 
precipitation in much later Saturday night. The Canadian and Euro 
are similar in their timing and track while the GFS is actually a 
bit sluggish with the progression of precipitation into the CWA. 
Given the glaring differences between the NBM and Global models have 
trended PoPs down to account for the much slower progression 
suggested by the Global suite. 

Sensible weather will start out dry and cool with temperatures in 
the low 60s expected Thursday. Friday will also be dry with temps 
increasing into the upper 60s to around 70. As mentioned above, 
there is quite a bit of model spread with the system that approaches 
the area this weekend. However, it is likely that all of eastern 
Kentucky sees at least some light rain, though, the timing of 
precipitation is up in the air. temperatures will cool toward the 
end of the period as cloud cover and precipitation chances increase.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Wednesday evening)
ISSUED AT 807 PM EDT TUE OCT 25 2022

VFR was observed across the region to begin the period and VFR is
expected to begin the period. However, as a cold front moves east
across the area, ceilings will decrease into the MVFR range during
the 6Z to 15Z period. Some showers will accompany and precede the
front. Once MVFR develops, MVFR and spotty IFR will prevail
through the end of the period. Winds will start from the southeast
to south at 5 to 10KT, before becoming southwest to west behind
the front at the same speeds. Gusts in the 10 to 20KT range are
also possible at times through the period.
