Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service State College PA
231 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Turning breezy tonight with rain showers fading over the western
Alleghenies. Expect seasonal temperatures through late week with
a slight warming trend to start the weekend. A 3 to 4 day 
period of dry weather is expected Thursday into the weekend with
rain likely on Halloween. No sign of winterlike conditions on
the horizon with odds tilted heavily in favor of above normal 
temperatures to start November.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 8 PM THIS EVENING/...
Shower activity will be focused over the western Alleghenies
this evening given proximity of departing upper trough and
upslope low level flow. Max POPs are over the NW mtns and 
Laurel ridges. Sfc cold front has reached southwest PA as of 
18Z and is fcst to accelerate eastward across CPA into NJ by 
00Z/8PM EDT.

&&

.SHORT TERM /8 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 AM THURSDAY/...
Pattern transitions to more typical cool season post frontal 
flow regime into tonight with northwest winds picking up across
CPA into early Thursday morning. The NW winds will direct
noticeably cooler air into CPA with MinTs fcst to drop 8 to 15F
NoN into the upper 30s along the Alleghenies to the upper 40s 
in the Lower Susq metros (still +5-10F above climo in most 
places). Clouds should persist the longest over the Alleghenies 
with clearing east of the mtns by Thursday morning. 

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Dry weather is expected Friday and Saturday with high pressure
centered over southern Ontario and Quebec. Seasonable highs and
lows are expected both Friday and Saturday with highs in the 50s
to lower 60s and lows in the 30s.

Continued the trend toward a dry Sunday though the NBM continues
to insist that rain comes in quicker Sunday afternoon and
evening. Dropped PoPs similar to previous shifts with strong
high pressure overhead still during the day Sunday which should
delay the arrival of rain until Sunday night or Monday.
A shortwave trough will swing over the commonwealth Monday and
Monday night leading to the aforementioned rain chances, though
the rain should remain generally light and depart by the middle
of the week as ridging build back over the region.

&&

.AVIATION /18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
MVFR/IFR conditions fcst at the western terminals as pattern
transition to post-frontal/NW flow. Shower activity over the
western airspace should gradually fade into tonight with partial
clearing/VFR expected downwind of the higher terrain. Winds from
190-260 degrees will shift to 270-340 degrees by early Thursday
with gusts up to 25kts at times. Look for lingering low cigs
over the western TAFs to trend VFR by Thursday afternoon. 

Outlook...

Fri/Sat...VFR/no sig wx expected. Patchy valley AM fog. 

Sun/Mon...Restrictions most likely Sunday night into Monday
along with rain spreading SW to NE. 

&&

.EQUIPMENT...
Scheduled maintenance on many regional ASOS sites will occur 
over the next few weeks. Interruptions will mainly be to the 
wind sensor data. But, at times, much of the observation data
may be interrupted.

&&
