.DISCUSSION...(This evening through Monday)
Issued at 117 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Summary: Briefly cooler through mid-week, then a warming trend and 
mainly dry through the end of October. Next chance for widespread 
precipitation mid to late next week - and almost certainly in the 
form of rain, not snow.

Today a reinforcing cold front is moving from west to east across 
the Upper Midwest resulting in just a few rain/snow showers and 
temperatures steady to falling behind the front. In the cooler post-
frontal cyclonic flow, scattered rain/snow showers may also develop 
across the international border tonight into early Wednesday - 
perhaps even some "lake effect" showers downwind (east-southeast) of 
Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake, but little to no accumulation is 
expected. 

A broad area of high pressure will build across the Midwest tonight 
into Thursday, with southwesterly flow at low/mid levels resulting 
in warm air advecting in from the southern Plains. With this warmer 
air will come a weak warm front on Thursday, bringing some clouds 
and a low chance for a light rain shower. 

Becoming warmer late-week and through Halloween next Monday with 
highs in the mid 50s and low temperatures in the mid to upper 30s - 
feeling more like early October than late October.

.AVIATION...(For the 06Z TAFS through 06Z Wednesday night)
Issued at 1233 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A weak trough of low pressure stretched from north-central South 
Dakota near Mobridge to near Thunder Bay, ON early this morning. A
few very light rain or snow showers were noted on radar over 
northeast Minnesota. Cold air advection near the surface should 
allow the boundary layer to stay mixed overnight resulting in some
wind gusts at the terminals of 15 to 20 knots. Otherwise look for
the MVFR/VFR ceilings to linger into the 13Z to 17Z time range. 
The ceilings are a bit tricky this morning as the cloud layer is 
mostly comprised of ice crystals, which forecast models struggle 
to represent. As such, skies may clear earlier than forecast or 
MVFR ceilings persist longer than forecast. Ceiling forecast 
confidence is medium. As high pressure moves toward the Upper 
Midwest from the Northern Plains tonight, look for winds to become
light and variable and back with time.

.MARINE...
Issued at 117 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

West-northwest winds at 10-15 knots gusting to 20-25 knots will
gradually decrease and become more northwesterly overnight
tonight. Northwest winds around 10-15 knots again on Wednesday,
diminishing to less than 10 knots Wednesday night. An isolated
shower or sprinkle is possible late today into tonight but
otherwise a dry forecast ahead. Small Craft Advisory for parts of
the south shore will be expired at 4pm as the winds and waves
diminish.
