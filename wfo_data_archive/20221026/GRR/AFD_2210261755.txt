.DISCUSSION...(Today through next Tuesday)
Issued at 330 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

-- Rain through the first half of the day, clearing Tonight --

The biggest forecast concern will be the position and track of a
TROWAL moving in conjunction with a deformation band moving 
across lower Michigan between 09Z to 12Z. A period of heavy rain 
will move northward with an additional 0.5 inch to an inch 
possible with the heaviest rain rates before sunrise. 

The upper level trough that is driving this system and will 
quickly move eastward this afternoon and continue east this 
evening. Expect strong downsloping flow to follow in the wake of 
this exiting system bringing strong gusty northerly winds. Cold 
air will return to the region with Max temperatures today much 
closer to normal, in the low 50. 

--Drier and cooler weather ahead --

Baroclinic, zonal flow will dominate the upper pattern, with high
pressure through the mid to low levels. This will keep drier air
over the region through the weekend. Temperatures will rebound
into the weekend, with highs in the low 60s this weekend. The next
chance for precipitation will be early next week.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Thursday afternoon)
Issued at 155 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The rain is moving east this afternoon but low stratus clouds will
remain into this evening. The stratus is fairly shallow with bases
around 2000 feet AGL and tops AOB 4000 feet. This stratus deck
should continue to thin this evening and scatter out by around
06Z. Then VFR is expected into Thursday afternoon.

North winds will gust to 20 knots at times through the afternoon
then winds will go northwest and decrease to less than 10 knots 
after 00Z.

.MARINE...
Issued at 330 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Strong northerly flow with a lot of fetch across the lake will
allow for winds and waves to ramp up behind the cold front. This
will spark gale conditions with the cold air advection mixing 25 
to 40 knot gales down to the lake through today. The burst of 
strongest winds are expected this morning then conditions will 
gradually improve as winds and waves will slowly diminish this evening.
