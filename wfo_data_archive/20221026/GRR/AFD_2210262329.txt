.DISCUSSION...(This evening through next Wednesday)
Issued at 321 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A thin but extensive deck of stratus clouds should persist into 
this evening before scattering out overnight as drying/subsidence
works in. Then fair weather persists under sfc and upper ridging 
into the weekend. 

Next chance of rain is late Sunday as moisture streams north from
the Gulf region with an upper low merging with a shortwave 
trough. Model ensemble means show highest QPF across eastern Lower
Michigan. Rain should be done by Monday evening with fair weather
to follow into the middle of next week.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Thursday evening)
Issued at 728 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The big question tonight is, does the MVFR stratus clouds prevail
through the night or will skies clear as forecast by most of the
models? At 23z all our the GRR TAF sites were MVFR due to clouds
bases just below 30000 ft alg. There is some suggestion in the
night time mircophysics cloud loopws, that the clearing is
progressing across Lake Michigan into southwest Lower Michigan. 
I have noted over the years that when the b0ack edge of the polar
jet moves north and east of here the clouds nearly alway break up.
Tonight that jet axis is east of us by 06z or so. Both of these
suggest clearing overnight so I will indeed put it in our TF
