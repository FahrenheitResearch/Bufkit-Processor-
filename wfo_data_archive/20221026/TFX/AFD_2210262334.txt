UPDATED AVIATION SECTION

.SYNOPSIS...

Snow showers across far southwest Montana will end this evening as
a weather disturbance in southeast Idaho moves off into Wyoming.
Dry and seasonably mild conditions are expected to follow through
the weekend with gusty winds across the north-central MT plains
and periods of strong winds likely along the Rocky Mountain Front.

.DISCUSSION...

A shortwave trough continued to trek east across the Northern 
Rockies today with an embedded mid level disturbance moving east 
just south of the MT/ID border this afternoon. Snow showers will 
generally remain confined to areas south of I-90 through early this 
evening with skies already clearing this afternoon across much of
central/north-central MT in the wake of this system. Through 6pm, 
there will be enough instability for a few intense bursts of snow
with some of the activity near the ID border before these showers
end from W to E through the rest of this evening. 

Attention then turns to the strong Pacific upper level jet 
currently streaming into NW Canada and the increased westerly flow
that develops across the Northern Rockies later tonight through 
Friday as the upper jet sinks south to a position just north of 
the US/Canadian border. Combination of strengthening surface high 
pressure across the US Rockies and low pressure emerging east of 
the Canadian Rockies by Thursday morning along with the increasing 
westerly flow aloft will bring strong winds to areas along the 
Rocky Mtn Front late tonight, spreading east into adjacent High 
Plains areas Thursday morning and as far east as I-15 corridor in
Toole county by late Thursday morning. Temperature/wind profiles 
still support some isolated very strong gusts to around 80 mph 
right along the Rocky Mtn Front Thursday morning with 60-70 mph
gusts likely as far east as Cut Bank. A High Wind Warning
continues for these areas with the start time moved to earlier
Thursday morning for areas near Cut Bank. 

A windy period is likely across much of the north-central MT plains 
from late tonight through early next week as fast westerly flow 
remains in place across the area. Overall wind gust speeds have 
decreased some on Thursday for areas east of I-15, largely due to 
the position of the upper jet and surface troughing in Canada 
trending a bit further north. The High Wind Watch for Cascade and
Judith Basin counties has been canceled with probabilistic 
guidance now only indicating isolated areas of wind gusts in 
excess of 55 mph in these areas. Still, widespread winds of 30-35
mph with gusts of 40-50 mph will be quite windy for these areas.

Friday through Monday period still looks dry and seasonably mild 
with daytime temps in the 50s to around 60. Breezy to windy 
conditions persist through the weekend across the plains with 
potential for stronger winds to develop again late Sunday through 
Monday as the next round of Pacific jet energy and upper 
troughing move in from the NW. Statistical blended model guidance 
continues to give greater than 50% probabilities for wind gusts in
excess of 55 mph Sunday and Monday for areas along and west of 
I-15 and across much of Cascade and Judith Basin counties. Looking
ahead, long range multi-model ensembles unanimously support a
deepening upper level trough in the western US by the middle of 
next week with typical variance in the timing and amplitude of 
troughing at this time range. While there is still considerable 
uncertainty regarding details, a trend to below average temperatures
and increasing chances for precipitation/snow is likely to begin 
November. Hoenisch

.AVIATION...
530 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022 (27/00Z TAF period)

VFR conditions will mostly persist through at least the next 24 
hours across North Central, Central, and Southwest Montana.

A northwest flow aloft with a passing disturbance will keep skies 
mostly cloudy along the Continental Divide and into Southwest 
Montana through around 15Z, possibly with some mountain top 
obscuring VFR ceilings. Areas of snow showers are also possible over 
these same areas through around 06Z, possibly with brief periods of 
MVFR conditions. Otherwise, skies will be partly cloudy with areas 
of mid and high level cloudiness passing overhead.

Gusty westerly winds will mostly decrease through 03Z, but they will 
increase again first along the Rocky Mountain Front after 06Z and 
spread southeast across the area through 18Z. Winds of 15 to 25 kt 
with gusts up to 35 kt will be common over the plains after 15Z; the 
strongest winds will be over the plains west of Interstate 15, where 
they will increase to between 30 and 40 kt with gusts in excess of 
50 kt. Mountain wave turbulence will be widespread across the area, 
and low level wind shear will be common on the Rocky Mountain Front 
as winds increase between 06Z and 18Z.
