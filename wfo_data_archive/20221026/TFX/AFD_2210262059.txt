.SYNOPSIS...

Snow showers across far southwest Montana will end this evening as
a weather disturbance in southeast Idaho moves off into Wyoming.
Dry and seasonably mild conditions are expected to follow through
the weekend with gusty winds across the north-central MT plains
and periods of strong winds likely along the Rocky Mountain Front.

.DISCUSSION...

A shortwave trough continued to trek east across the Northern 
Rockies today with an embedded mid level disturbance moving east 
just south of the MT/ID border this afternoon. Snow showers will 
generally remain confined to areas south of I-90 through early this 
evening with skies already clearing this afternoon across much of
central/north-central MT in the wake of this system. Through 6pm, 
there will be enough instability for a few intense bursts of snow
with some of the activity near the ID border before these showers
end from W to E through the rest of this evening. 

Attention then turns to the strong Pacific upper level jet 
currently streaming into NW Canada and the increased westerly flow
that develops across the Northern Rockies later tonight through 
Friday as the upper jet sinks south to a position just north of 
the US/Canadian border. Combination of strengthening surface high 
pressure across the US Rockies and low pressure emerging east of 
the Canadian Rockies by Thursday morning along with the increasing 
westerly flow aloft will bring strong winds to areas along the 
Rocky Mtn Front late tonight, spreading east into adjacent High 
Plains areas Thursday morning and as far east as I-15 corridor in
Toole county by late Thursday morning. Temperature/wind profiles 
still support some isolated very strong gusts to around 80 mph 
right along the Rocky Mtn Front Thursday morning with 60-70 mph
gusts likely as far east as Cut Bank. A High Wind Warning
continues for these areas with the start time moved to earlier
Thursday morning for areas near Cut Bank. 

A windy period is likely across much of the north-central MT plains 
from late tonight through early next week as fast westerly flow 
remains in place across the area. Overall wind gust speeds have 
decreased some on Thursday for areas east of I-15, largely due to 
the position of the upper jet and surface troughing in Canada 
trending a bit further north. The High Wind Watch for Cascade and
Judith Basin counties has been canceled with probabilistic 
guidance now only indicating isolated areas of wind gusts in 
excess of 55 mph in these areas. Still, widespread winds of 30-35
mph with gusts of 40-50 mph will be quite windy for these areas.

Friday through Monday period still looks dry and seasonably mild 
with daytime temps in the 50s to around 60. Breezy to windy 
conditions persist through the weekend across the plains with 
potential for stronger winds to develop again late Sunday through 
Monday as the next round of Pacific jet energy and upper 
troughing move in from the NW. Statistical blended model guidance 
continues to give greater than 50% probabilities for wind gusts in
excess of 55 mph Sunday and Monday for areas along and west of 
I-15 and across much of Cascade and Judith Basin counties. Looking
ahead, long range multi-model ensembles unanimously support a
deepening upper level trough in the western US by the middle of 
next week with typical variance in the timing and amplitude of 
troughing at this time range. While there is still considerable 
uncertainty regarding details, a trend to below average temperatures
and increasing chances for precipitation/snow is likely to begin 
November. Hoenisch

.AVIATION...
1200 PM MDT Wed Oct 26 2022 (26/18Z TAF period)

Weather system moving across southern ID this afternoon will 
continue to spread broken mid level clouds and scattered snow 
showers across SW MT through early this evening. Mtn obscuration will 
be widespread across SW MT with mainly VFR conditions at terminals 
though brief MVFR/IFR is possible directly beneath showers, mainly 
south of KDLN to KEKS. Further north, VFR conditions prevail with 
scattered to broken high level clouds. Surface winds will be 
variable and generally light through this afternoon across SW MT 
with westerly surface winds across north-central MT, increasing 
later tonight. Hoenisch 

KWYS TAF will not be issued again until airport operations resume 
next spring.

and hazard information.
