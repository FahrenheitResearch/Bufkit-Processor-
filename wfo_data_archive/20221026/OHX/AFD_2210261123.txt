.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 212 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Cold front has moved through the area, and showers are well off to
the east. A few light showers have developed overnight with the
low cloud deck, but shouldnt amount to much across the area. Temps
will be cooler today thanks to the front, with westerly winds
becoming more northwesterly later today. High temps will be in the
low 50s on the Plateau up to the low 60s west. Lows tonight will
get into the upper 30s northwest and low 40s south with continued
drier conditions. Temps will warm up a bit Thursday with some
southwest flow returning aloft, getting us into the mid to upper
60s for highs in the afternoon.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday Night through next Wednesday)
Issued at 212 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Getting into the day on Friday, a strong upper closed low will
dive southward in the Plains into TX, then start moving ENE
towards the mid state. Models have the low weakening as it moves
east, but will bring rain chances this weekend. Ensembles have
some showers moving into the southwest as early as Saturday
morning, but showers look more likely later in the day Saturday
into Saturday night. The best chances for rain will be late
Saturday night into the day Sunday as the upper trough moves
overhead. Right now, models are not showing too much instability,
so chances for thunderstorms is low. Should the low linger a bit
longer over the region and bring additional WAA, we may see better
chances for storms. But for now, this looks to primarily be a rain
event with a half inch to an inch of rain widespread across the
mid state through Monday morning. Models start to diverge quite a
bit starting next week, with long term models bringing shortwaves
through the area but not much precip with them. Kept the extended
dry for now.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 619 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Clouds wrapping around the backside of yesterday's weather maker 
will provide mainly MVFR cigs into this afternoon for BNA/MQY/CKV
before conditions improve back to VFR. CSV will catch the brunt 
of this, with on-and-off IFR cigs today. Solid MVFR cigs may 
return by this evening for CSV but it could be Thursday morning 
before clouds completely clear off the Plateau.

Winds will remain breezy behind yesterday's front. Westerly winds
this morning will become northwesterly by 17Z today and northerly
by the end of the day.
