...New AVIATION...

.UPDATE...
Issued at 712 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Rain is making its way through the forecast area. By midnight or
slightly before it will be all gone. Updated the grids to remove
the tornado watch /a couple of hours ago/ and to remove the wind
advisory that just expired. Most places across the CWA got rain
today and some place even got an inch plus. Not sure how much of
an effect this will have on drought conditions...but it at least 
helped the dry fire concerns. The remainder of tonight once the 
rain moves out will leave cloudy skies and lows in the 40s. Made a
few tweaks to overnight lows across the south. Will have to 
update the forecast again later for removing the rain as it moves 
out of the CWA.

.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Thursday Night) 
Issued at 224 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Band of convection now moving across the TN river. Instability has 
been very limited but forcing and shear is lining up. No history of 
any wind damage as of yet but we could still get a couple strong or 
even severe storms in our southwest in the next couple of hours. Mid 
level weak rotation has been indicated to our west so perhaps a 
spinup or two in our southwest as well. The tornado watch does 
include Wayne Lawrence and Giles counties and is in effect until 7 
pm. Otw, one half to three quarters of an inch can be expected in 
terms of rainfall. The activity will spread eastward reaching the i-
65 corridor between 4 pm and 6 pm, and then the Plateau after 7 pm. 
By 9 pm or 10 pm, the consequential convection will be exiting our 
cwa.  

In the post frontal sector, the upper low will lift northeast and 
along the OH River. NVA is the dominating mode in the potential dry 
sector area. Thus, we will undergo a dry slot which means pops will 
drop off quickly this evening. We could still hang on to some 
isolated showers in our north and northwest into and perhaps 
through mid evening. 

Moving on, surface high to build in on Wednesday. Temperatures will 
cool to more seasonal levels.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through next Tuesday)
Issued at 224 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

In the extended forecast, upper low over the southern rockies will 
move eastward and bring some active weather to the deep and perhaps 
mid south. Associated surface low will strengthen over the 
northwestern gulf. This feature will weaken as it moves our way but 
will still bring a slug of shower activity across the area this 
weekend. Rainfall amounts look like a third to one half of an inch. 
The aforementioned upper low will weaken as well but as an open wave 
will take its time exiting the area. Thus, some light shower 
activity could persist into Monday. 

For the extended temps, values will run close to normal although 
diurnal spreads will be on the low side given the clouds and 
showers. Its looking slightly warmer into mid week.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1222 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Clouds wrapping around the backside of our current weather maker
will provide mainly MVFR cigs into Wednesday afternoon for 
BNA/MQY/CKV before conditions improve back to VFR. CSV will catch
the brunt of this, with IFR cigs starting around 10Z tonight.
MVFR cigs may return by Wednesday evening for CSV but it could be
Thursday morning before clouds completely clear off the Plateau.

Winds will shift overnight and remain breezy behind the front.
Westerly winds tonight will be northwesterly by 17Z Wednesday and
northerly by the end of the day.
