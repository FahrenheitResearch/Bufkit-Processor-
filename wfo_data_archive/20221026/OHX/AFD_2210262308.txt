.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Thursday Night)
Issued at 208 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Visible satellite imagery indicates some clearing will occur
across the western portions of the mid-state this evening with a
brief shot of sunshine before the sun sets for areas along and
west of I-65. Clear skies will persist through tomorrow night,
with afternoon temperatures a few degrees warmer tomorrow than
what they were today.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through next Wednesday)
Issued at 208 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

By Friday afternoon increasing and lowering clouds will be noted
for the southern counties with rain chances returning on Saturday.
This much welcomed rain will spread northward Saturday night and
linger through Sunday night. More moderate to briefly heavy
showers can be expected on Sunday, along with the low chance for a
rumble of thunder. The rain is expected to move out of the area on
Monday as the upper level low departs the region, but some light
rain showers of sprinkles may be possible during the first couple
of hours of trick or treating. Temperatures will also cool during
Monday evening from the low 60s into the upper 50s, so keep that
in mind for your costume choice.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, clear skies and mild temperatures will
return with afternoon highs once again reaching the 70s for
Wednesday.
