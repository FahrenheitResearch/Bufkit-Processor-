...PATCHY DENSE FOG NORTHWESTERN NORTH DAKOTA THIS MORNING...

Patchy dense fog is starting to dissipate over northwest North
Dakota, especially south of Lake Sakakawea. However, there are
still some areas of reduced visibilities north of the Lake,
especially along portions of Highway 2 in Mountrail and eastern
Williams counties. Motorists should be prepared for rapidly 
changing visibilities, and use low beam headlights. Be extra 
cautious at intersections and railroad crossings.

The fog will continue to slowly dissipate by mid to late morning.
