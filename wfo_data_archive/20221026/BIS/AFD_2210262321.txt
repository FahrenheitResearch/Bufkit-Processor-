AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Bismarck ND
621 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.UPDATE...
Issued at 621 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

We have updated the PoPs for later tonight to push them back a few
hours. The latest Hi-RES models have rain moving into the south
central around 05z now. Still a slight chance however. The rest of
the forecast remains on track.

.SHORT TERM...(This Evening through Thursday night)
Issued at 214 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Light precipitation is possible tonight into Thursday morning in 
the south central as weak shortwave energy passes through the 
Dakotas. Based on forecast soundings, the lower atmosphere should 
be warm enough to prevent any snow and keep the precipitation 
type as rain only. Any rain totals will likely be light at a 
couple to few hundredths of an inch at most. Beyond that, expect 
quiet weather through the period.

For tonight, light winds are expected across the area, with partly 
cloudy skies north. This will likely allow the development of 
patchy fog once again in much of the northern and parts of the 
western CWA. This is especially true in the northwest where 
melting snow this afternoon will provide additional boundary layer
moisture to support fog development. 

For the most part, winds remain light on Thursday and transition
from a southerly to southwesterly direction. Once winds become 
southwesterly, a little downslope enhancement along the Missouri 
Coteau will lead to a narrow strip of breezy conditions. This will
be most discernible from surrounding winds Thursday night. 
Temperatures will be seasonable for this time of year with highs 
limited to the mid 40s in parts of the northwest due to existing 
snowpack, and to the mid 50s elsewhere. Lows tonight and Thursday 
night will mostly drop into the mid 20s to mid 30s.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday) 
Issued at 214 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Zonal flow aloft will dominate the majority of the period before
indications are that a west CONUS trough will develop beyond
Monday, or likely in the Tuesday/Wednesday timeframe. As a 
result, mostly dry and seasonably above average temperatures are 
expected with highs in the 50s to low 60s through Monday. Through 
Monday night, lows will mostly be in the 30s with an occasional 
upper 20s or low 40s reading mixed in as well. To go along with 
the developing west CONUS trough, NBM ensemble forecasts suggest a
cooling trend beyond next Monday, along with increased 
precipitation chances.
