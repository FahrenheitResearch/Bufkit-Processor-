...PATCHY DENSE FOG NORTHWESTERN NORTH DAKOTA THIS MORNING...

Patchy dense fog will reduce the visibility to one quarter mile 
at times in parts of northwest North Dakota this morning, 
especially in areas that still have some snow remaining. Motorists 
should be prepared for rapidly changing visibilities, and should 
use extra caution traveling. Use low beam headlights and be extra 
cautious at intersections and railroad crossings.

The fog will dissipate by mid morning.
