.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday Night)
Issued at 344 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

High pressure overhead, zonal flow aloft and PWATS under 0.5 inches 
will leave us with calm and pleasant weather for today. Feint 
ridging at 850mb and diminishing CAA will bring warmer temperatures 
this afternoon with highs in the mid to upper 70s. Later tonight 
surface high pressure should drift east into the Mississippi River 
Valley, allowing for onshore flow to resume. Clear skies will still 
allow for effective radiative cooling during the overnight hours, so 
expect lows to be in the 40s to 50s inland and upper 50s to lower 
60s along the coast. 

Thursday will see an upper level trough dig in over the Four Corners
/Central Rockies with a deepening surface low over the TX/OK 
panhandle. Onshore flow and moisture advection should strengthen in 
response as dewpoints begin to climb back into the 50s and 60s in 
areas along the coast. 850mbs temperatures will rise to around 12-
15C with highs reaching the upper 70s to lower 80s during the 
afternoon. Heading into Thursday evening PWATS will rise into the 
1.3-1.8" range as an inverted trough/low at the surface slides up 
the South TX coastline. This surge in moisture, paired with 
shortwave energy from the aforementioned upper level trough and 
increasing surface convergence should bring scattered showers and 
thunderstorms across the region late Thursday night, continuing into 
Friday morning in advance of our next cold front.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday) 
Issued at 344 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Friday will be wet for a majority of Southeast Texas as the next mid/upper
level low moves slowly eastward across the state. This system's associated
surface low and cold front will work their way eastward across Southeast
Texas, and there will be some potential for strong and/or severe thunderstorm
development along with the potential for excessive rainfall. Areas of
rain with embedded showers and thunderstorms can be expected to develop
with this system, and if the frontal timing along with daytime heating
and associated destabilization all fall into place, low level convergence
and a divergent flow aloft along with precipitable water values possibly
approaching two inches would be supportive of some storms becoming strong
or severe and some locally heavy rainfall. Agree with the current SPC
and WPC Day 3 Outlooks that have a Marginal risk for a large portion
of our area, and would not be surprised if these risks get upgraded
in their future Day 2 and Day 1 Outlooks. Once we get the cold front
and the main rain area off to our east, look for cooler temperatures
along with some wraparound cloud cover for the area over the weekend
as high pressure moves on in. A warmup is in store for the first half
of next week as the high moves off to the east and moisture levels begin
to slowly rise from the onshore flow that develops. We could get our
next shot of rain around midweek in association with the next much weaker
disturbance that moves across the state.

For high temperatures, look for 60/70s Friday thru Sunday followed by
70s/80s Monday thru Wednesday. For low temperatures, look for mainly
50s Saturday thru Tuesday followed by 50s/60s on Wednesday.

.MARINE...
Issued at 344 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Northeast to east winds today will become east to southeast tonight
through Thursday night as high pressure moves off to the east. Expect
showers and thunderstorms to return to the area mainly Thursday night
through Friday afternoon or evening in association with the next surface
low and cold front. Caution flags and maybe advisories will be possible
ahead of the front. Mainly moderate northwest winds and elevated seas
can be expected Friday night through Saturday night. Caution flags are
likely, and advisories might be needed. Expect winds and seas to be
on a decreasing trend Sunday and Sunday night as high pressure settles
into the area.
