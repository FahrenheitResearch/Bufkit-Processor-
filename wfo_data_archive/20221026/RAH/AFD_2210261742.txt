Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Raleigh NC
120 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
A cold front will move through the region tonight. Cool high 
pressure extending into the region from the Great Lakes on Thursday 
will strengthen as it shifts into the northeast United States into 
the weekend.

.NEAR TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
As of 1000 AM Wednesday...

At 13Z the surface cold front was pushing into Upstate SC but was 
hung up in the NC mountains.  Ahead of the front, a narrow band of 
diminishing warm advection showers is shifting east through the 
Piedmont, producing on a hundredth or two of rain in a few areas. 
Visibility has been slow improving areawide, but some fog still 
persists in the coastal plain.  Satellite imagery and the slow 
progression of the cold front, whose parent low is well off to the 
north in the Great lakes region, suggest the copious amount of low 
level moisture over the area will be slow to erode.  Adjustments to 
the forecast have been to maintains a little more cloud cover 
and slow the warming into the mid-afternoon hours, with highs still 
ranging from mid 60s north to upper 70s south.  Will assess the 
potential for some fog early tonight with the afternoon update. -BLS

As the front moves through tonight, any widely isolated showers will 
exit the southern Coastal Plain. A 1026mb surface high pressure is 
forecast to settle into the lower Great Lakes to upper Ohio Valley 
by early Thu, resulting in northerly flow and temperatures from the 
middle 40s in the north/northwest to lower 50s in the SE. Drier air 
and stirring behind the front should prevent another night of fog. -

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT/...
As of 350 AM Wednesday...

West-southwest flow at mid-levels will exist over the area early 
Thu. A mid-level ridge will settle off the SE US during the 
afternoon and into early Fri. The chilly 1030mb surface high 
pressure over the Great Lakes will strengthen and move into the 
northeast US by early Fri. CAA and low-level thicknesses behind the 
front are forecast to be around 1360m, about 25m lower than Wed. 
Although it will be sunny, lowered highs to account for the cooler 
airmass. Temperatures will be near to slightly below seasonal 
normals in the mid to upper 60s in the north and lower 70s in the 
south. Forecast soundings indicate continued stirring of the surface 
wind Thu night tied to the pressure gradient from the surface high. 
This should temper overnight lows, which would otherwise support 
upper 30s to lower 40s under optimal radiational cooling (1000-925 
mb thicknesses near 642m). Expect lows in the middle 40s to around 
50, except lower 40s in outlying areas.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
As of 300 AM Wednesday...

The mid/upper level shortwave ridge over the SE US will hang on over 
the region through late Saturday as a southern stream closed low 
briefly cuts off over the Southern Plains and Lower MS Valley.
While central NC is likely to see ample cloudiness Friday and 
Saturday, it should remain mostly dry across the area with 
seasonably cool daytime highs owing to the cloud cover and NELY low-
level associated with the strong ~1035mb surface high extending down 
the Eastern Seaboard. Conversely, the cloud cover will result in 
mild, above-normal overnight low temperatures. 

The upper level ridge will shift offshore early Sunday with moisture 
transport/advection strengthening over the region throughout the day 
and into the night as the closed low opens up and ejects NEWD into 
the Ohio Valley. Model spread remains high WRT the timing of the 
arrival and the eastern extent of the steadier precip into the area. 
With that said, expect to see increasing rain chances area-wide late 
Sunday and into Sunday night.

Furthermore, it's looking increasingly likely that high rain chances 
will linger through Monday night, as additional trailing shortwave 
energy ejecting east through the southern Plains extends the 
duration of southerly upglide and lift over the Carolinas until it's 
passage Tuesday, which would negatively impact Trick-or Treat 
activities across central NC. 

Temperatures will ultimately depend on the onset timing of the 
deeper cloud cover and rain, with the likely development of cold air 
damming conditions over the Carolina Piedmont Sunday and Monday, 
featuring a climatologically sharper NW to SE temperatures gradient. 
In terms of potential rainfall amounts, while uncertainty remains 
high, some beneficial heavy rainfall is possible, especially across 
western NC where 2-day rain totals of 1-1.5" are possible.

.AVIATION /18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
As of 120 PM Wednesday... 

24-hour TAF period: Aviation conditions have been improving very 
slowly today and remain sub-VFR at GSO/INT/RDU, where IFR and MVFR 
have only very recently developed.  Abundant low-level moisture and 
cold front that is only now starting to emerge east of the 
mountains will keep some low clouds across the Piedmont for a few 
more hours before drier air finally starts to filter into the area. 
Expect VFR everywhere by 00Z, though there may be a brief period of 
lower vsbys invof RDU/FAY/RWI between 00Z and 06Z before the nwrly 
winds and drier air take over.

Winds will then shift to nerly during the day tomorrow, with some 
gusts to 20kt possibly across the east.

Outlook: A prolonged period of moist low-level easterly flow will 
favor periods of IFR/MVFR ceilings Friday into Sunday.
