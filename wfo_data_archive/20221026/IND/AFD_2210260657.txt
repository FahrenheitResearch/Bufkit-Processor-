.Short Term...(Today and tonight)
Issued at 254 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Highlights: 

* Lingering light showers this morning, with increasing sun (west
  to east) this afternoon. 

* Patchy fog possible over the next two mornings


Wednesday...

The upper level low of the system that lead to widespread rain and 
windy conditions yesterday will pass through central Indiana this 
morning. A subgeostrophic minimum in the base of the trough along 
with steep negative tilt will create a CVA maximum over the northern 
Ohio Valley. In return, this will progress the upper level low to 
the NE, through northern Indiana and Michigan. Beneath the low, 
elevated moisture and strong cyclonic flow will lead to widespread 
clouds and scattered weak showers. Highest coverage will be over 
northern portions of central Indiana, where cloud bases are lower, 
corresponding to higher near surface moisture. An additional 0.05"-
0.10" will be possible in far NE central Indiana. Early this 
morning, 500-1000 foot cloud decks, with high near surface
moisture from prior rainfall could lead to patchy fog, with 
visibilities between 1-3 SM. 

Eventually, cool, dry air from the west will push into the region, 
drying the low to mid levels and mixing out cloud cover. 
Temperatures this afternoon will be directly related to the 
timing of clearing, with western portions of the state slightly 
warmer due to more prolonged SW radiation. Current expectation are
for highs in the mid to upper 50s, with a few far SW locations 
reaching/exceeding 60. 

The same, seasonal airmass will remain over central Indiana 
tonight. Some model members are picking up on a mid level moisture
lobe wrapping around the upper level low as its over 
Michigan/Quebec overnight. This could lead to patchy cloud cover 
with bases around 5000 feet. Cloud coverage will be highest over 
NE central Indiana; closer proximity to the low. These clouds will
actually help combat the temperature gradient over central 
Indiana, limiting temperature decreases over the cooler NE portion
of the area. All in all, most areas will bottom out around 35-37 
degrees. High surface moisture in the presence of mid 30 degree 
temps could lead to some patchy frost on elevated surfaces, but 
the ground should avoid any deposition.

.Long Term...(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 254 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

- Dry Thursday through Saturday.

- More showers Saturday night through Monday.

- Near to slightly above normal temperatures by Friday after a cool 
  start on Thursday.

The long term will start off with surface high pressure over the 
Great Lakes, southwest flow aloft over the Ohio Valley and an upper 
low in the vicinity of Colorado/Utah/Wyoming. The surface high will 
gradually move into New England this weekend as the upper low 
initially intensifies and moves across northern Texas and to near 
Jonesboro, Arkansas, by 12z Sunday. This will spin up a Gulf surface 
system that will eventually weaken as it lifts northeast across the 
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes, very late this weekend or early next 
week. The upper low will likewise open up over the Mississippi 
Valley, late in the weekend and early next week before it gets 
absorbed into the northern stream. Meanwhile, yet another wave, this 
time within the broader central states trough, will lift northeast 
across the vicinity sometime in the early or middle part of next 
week. 

Synoptic lift will weaken with the southern system as it gets closer 
to the Ohio Valley. So, not expecting a significant rain event. 
However, PWATs to 1.2 inches could still see some locales realizing 
a quarter inch or more QPF before all is said and done. The 00z GFS 
and 00z ECMWF are close in timing with these features with the best 
chances and coverage from Sunday to Monday. 

Moisture will be lacking and along with only weak synoptic lift 
from the trailing wave, will keep it dry after Monday. 

With surface high pressure over the Great Lakes Thursday and mid and 
high clouds moving in the southwest flow aloft ahead of the upper 
low, temperatures will be below normal with highs only in the 50s 
over most locales. Meanwhile, cloud cover and decent surface 
pressure gradient should prevent decoupling, however, northeast 
winds will still make upper 30s likely for overnight lows most 
spots. Should see some more sunshine on Friday and Saturday as the 
column dries up substantially and winds eventually back to southeast 
in the wake of the departed high pressure. This should allow 
temperatures to return to seasonable and above with highs in the 
60s. Eventually, winds become southwest around high pressure from 
the Gulf to the Ohio Valley next week. That and some sunshine 
support slightly above normal temperatures.

.Aviation...(06Z TAF Issuance)
Issued at 114 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Impacts:
-MVFR to IFR cigs beginning 07-08Z through 13Z tomorrow.
-Wind shift from 250 to 340 tonight into tomorrow.
-Isolated wind gusts to 20 kts at KLAF this afternoon

Discussion: 

Winds have begun to shift from the SW to W at IND and will shortly 
do so at the other terminals as the heavier rain that brought MVFR to 
IFR vsbys to the area begins to wrap up.  Brief and light rain is 
possible through the night, but coverage and frequency will be too 
low for a specific mention in the TAF.  Cigs will fall to IFR over 
the course of the night with gradual improvement into the daytime 
hours tomorrow.  Winds will then become more northwesterly with 
occasional gusts to 20kts during the afternoon.
