.DISCUSSION...

Tonight through Thursday Night...

Upper trough was pushing through Idaho into Wyoming this
afternoon, with moisture and instability wrapping into the region.
Snow showers will affect the southwest mountains and adjacent
foothills this afternoon through the evening. With steep lapse
rates in place, a quick 2 to 5 inches is possible for the
Absaroka/Beartooth mountains, highest on south and west facing
slopes. Low temperatures in the 20s to lower 30s can be expected
tonight.

Mostly dry conditions will prevail on Thursday, as high pressure
begins to build into the region in the wake of the upper trough.
Temperatures will be a few degrees warmer with highs mainly in the
50s. As high pressure builds into the region, surface pressure
gradients will tighten along the western foothills, becoming 
strong Thursday evening and night. Local guidance suggests wind 
gusts of 50 to 60 mph are possible for the Livingston and Nye 
areas Thursday evening into Friday morning. Will continue to 
monitor for possible wind highlites. STP

Friday through Wednesday...

Dry and mild weather will continue through Sunday with generally
zonal flow over the area.

Sunday night into Monday, the jet stream will move southward over
Montana as models project a ridge developing over the northeast
Pacific Ocean and a trough forming over western Canada. These
stronger winds aloft will cause surface lee troughing to the east
of the mountains, and facilitate a strengthened sea-level pressure
gradient south of Livingston-Nye. The SLP gradient and strengthened
mid-level winds will produce strong wind gusts in the Livingston 
to Nye corridor Sunday night into Monday with gusts to 50-60 mph 
possible. This wind forecast has been retained in the forecast and
continues to look on track.

There is decent agreement in the ensembles showing the upper 
trough digging deeper late Monday into Tuesday, which would cause
the SLP gradient and mid-level winds to relax, so that the winds 
in the Livingston-Nye corridor weaken. The trough will also 
introduce snow showers in the mountain and rain/snow showers in 
the lower elevations.

High temperatures will generally be in the 50s to lower 60s Friday
through Monday then 40s and 50s Tuesday and 30s and 40s for
Wednesday.

In general, VFR will prevail through the period. A passing
disturbance will bring snow showers to the southwest mountains and
rain/snow showers to the adjacent foothills through this evening.
The southwest mountains will be obscured through tonight.
Southwest surface winds will increase at KLVM tonight, with gusts
to 30 kts possible by Thursday morning. STP
