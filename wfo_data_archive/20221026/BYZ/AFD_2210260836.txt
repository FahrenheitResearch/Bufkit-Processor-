.DISCUSSION...
Today through Thursday Night...

A trough currently over Washington will track across Idaho and 
into Wyoming by this evening. Models agree that most of its energy
will drop well south of our CWA providing mainly a glancing blow 
to our SW mountains and nearby areas. However, there is enough 
lift and instability suggested in soundings for the high country 
of the Absarokas/Beartooths to pick up a quick 3-5 inches of 
snowfall late today through the evening. Snow levels may drop to 
around 4500 ft this evening, but by then the best lift and 
moisture may have dropped south. So the nearby foothills are not 
likely to see much accumulation with only around an inch or less 
expected. Elsewhere, winds will be lighter today with highs in the
upper 40s to lower 50s. 

By Thursday morning the upper trough is progged to be cut off over
southern Wyoming well to our south. We should see mostly sunny
skies and temps a little warmer in the lower to mid 50s for most
locations. High pressure aloft will begin to build into the
inner Rockies. Surface pressures will react and create a strong
pressure gradient over the western foothills Thursday evening.
Progs indicate a pressure difference from Idaho Falls to Lewistown
reaching 12-16 mb which is adequate for advisory level wind gusts
Thursday night in our gap locations. Soundings also suggest a
decent inversion at mountain top level. Only weak ingredient is
light 700 mb winds (less than 30 kts). So mainly a pressure 
gradient driven wind. Local forecast studies have about a 55 
percent chance of reaching 60 mph at Livingston. We have bumped up
wind speeds in the gap areas from Livingston to Nye and also near
Big Timber for Thursday night. Future shifts will continue to 
monitor for possible wind highlight as time frame nears. BT 

Friday through Tuesday...

Semi-zonal upper flow will bring dry and mild weather through
Sunday.

Sunday night into Monday, the jet stream will move southward over
Montana as models project a ridge developing over the northeast
Pacific Ocean and a trough forming over western Canada. These
stronger winds aloft will cause surface lee troughing to the east
of the mountains, and facilitate a strengthened sea-level pressure
gradient south of Livingston-Nye. The SLP gradient and
strengthened mid-level winds will produce strong wind gusts in the
Livingston to Nye corridor Sunday night into Monday with gusts to
50-60 mph possible.

Models project the upper trough to dig farther southward later
Monday into Tuesday, which will cause the SLP gradient and mid-
level winds to relax, so that the winds in the Livingston-Nye
corridor weaken. The trough will also introduce snow showers in
the mountain and rain/snow showers in the lower elevations.

High temperatures will generally be in the 50s to lower 60s Friday
through Monday then 40s and 50s Tuesday. RMS

.AVIATION...

Today, there will be scattered rain/snow showers in the 
Absaroka/Beartooth foothills and snow showers in the mountains. 
The Belt, Snowy, Crazy and Absaroka/Beartooth Mountains will be 
obscured today. Otherwise, VFR will prevail during the TAF period.
