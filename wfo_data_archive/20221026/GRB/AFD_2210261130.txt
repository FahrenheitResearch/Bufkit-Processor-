Updated aviation portion for 12Z TAF issuance

.SHORT TERM...Today...Tonight...and Thursday
Issued at 326 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Rain associated with the low pressure system in Lower MI shifted 
east of the region early this morning, leaving dry conditions
over GRB CWA. Stratus clouds lingered along the lakeshore, and
over much of north central and far northeast WI, with mainly high
clouds over central WI and the Fox Valley. Northwest winds were
gusting to 15 to 20 mph at times. The combination of clouds and
winds kept the temperatures from falling much, with readings 
mainly in the middle 30s to middle 40s.

Clouds are expected to decrease from west to east across the
southern part of the forecast area this morning. Stratus will 
likely linger into early to mid afternoon across parts of north 
central and far northeast WI, aided by northwest flow off Lake 
Superior. Northwest winds will gust to 15 to 25 mph in most 
areas, with the highest gusts near Lake Michigan. High
temperatures should be in the lower to middle 40s in north
central WI, and upper 40s to lower 50s elsewhere.

High pressure will bring clear to partly cloudy skies tonight
and Thursday. Cannot rule out the possibility of patchy fog
late tonight, but given the dryness of the incoming air mass,
will hold off on any mention at this time. Lows tonight
should be in the 20s and lower 30s. Highs on Thursday will
be a little milder, with readings in the 50s.

.LONG TERM...Thursday Night Through Tuesday
Issued at 326 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A split flow regime will dominate the extended forecast Thursday
night through Saturday, keeping quiet weather in place. At the 
surface, high pressure will drift towards the eastern Great Lakes,
shifting winds to the south during this period. Despite no major
airmass exchanges, weak southerly flow and sunny skies will work
together to bring high temperatures into the upper 50s and lower
60s.

Sunday, the southern stream system is expected to rejoin the main
flow and bring a broad low pressure system south and east of our
area. The forecast remains dry for this period, Sunday night into
Monday, but an increase in cloud cover can be expected.

As we get into next week, quiet conditions will persist but the
overall pattern will begin building in amplitude again as an upper
trough digs into western CONUS. This will keep the above normal
temperatures in place for early next week as well.

.AVIATION...for 12Z TAF Issuance
Issued at 623 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

MVFR stratus was observed across most of the forecast area early
this morning, and patchy drizzle was reported in Vilas County. 
Northwest winds were occasionally gusting to 15 to 20 kts.

Low clouds will gradually erode during the late morning and early
afternoon, and will be most persistent over far northern WI.
Northwest winds will continue to gust to near 20 kts. High 
pressure arriving from the west will bring clearing skies, and 
result in decreasing winds later in the afternoon.

Decided not to mention any fog in the TAFs for late tonight, given
the dryness of the incoming air mass.
