.DISCUSSION...(This evening through Wednesday)
Issued at 229 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Key Messages:

- Chance for showers in western Minnesota tomorrow morning, weakening
  by the middle of the day. Cloudy for much of the area tomorrow.

- Quiet and dry weather return after Thursday and continue through
  the weekend, with above normal temperatures through at least the
  middle of next week.

Tonight and Thursday...
Now that a few of the CAMs have begun to resolve the precipitation
potential for western Minnesota tomorrow, the signal for rainfall is
a bit stronger than 24 hours ago. The HRRR has a decent amount of
scattered showers making it as far east as the western Twin Cities
Metro around sunrise tomorrow, with stronger showers mainly confined
to southwestern Minnesota. These showers will form along the nose of
a weak low level jet, with low to mid level moisture and WAA
resulting in the showers. As we head into daylight, this jet will
weaken and cut off both the lift and moisture, thus the showers
should dissipate fairly quickly once we reach the middle of the day
and afternoon. For those that do not see rain, we will end up being
cloudier than it has been over the past few days and cloudier than it
will be as we head into the weekend, with clearing gradually through
late Thursday into Friday.

Friday through Wednesday...
Upper level flow returns to primarily zonal over our coverage area,
with a cut off system remaining far to our south and primarily
affecting the southernmost states. This likely will keep any further
precipitation chances through the period to a minimum, with weak
surface high pressure lingering in the northern plains as we remain
moisture starved. Temperatures under this scheme will remain above
normal in the mid 50s to low 60s for highs compared to normals around
50 this late in October. It is looking to be a great day for
Halloween on Monday, with high temperatures in the upper 50s to mid
60s under mostly sunny skies which will linger into the evening. Our
nights will continue remain above freezing, dropping into the upper
30s to low 40s. Precipitation chances will remain absent with a lack
of both forcing and moisture, however this could change as we head
towards the end of next week. A few long-range models and ensembles
are beginning to show potential for a pattern shift, with a more
active upper level pattern aiding in guiding a more dynamic surface
regime to the area. This is still in the 200-240 hour time frame and
thus heavily subject to change.

WI will continue to scatter out as we head into the afternoon. Winds
fairly light at 300-330 right now will slowly shift towards 240-270
by this evening, with speeds weakening at or below 3kts. A final
shift to 140-170 will arrive early in the morning on Thursday, with
speeds remaining light. CIGS return by the last 8 hours of the
period, remaining VFR and generally above 060.

KMSP...No additional concerns. The gradual wind shift tonight is the
only minor concern.
