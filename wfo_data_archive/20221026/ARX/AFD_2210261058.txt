.DISCUSSION...(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 245 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Key Messages:

 - Mainly dry weather expected through early next week with temps
   trending back above average late this week.

Early this morning, a mid-level circulation was evident on water 
vapor imagery across the Ohio Valley with an additional shortwave 
trough approaching the western Great Lakes. Dry weather is
expected today with subsidence behind the shortwave trough, but 
modest low-level cold advection will hold temps a few degrees 
below average.

On Thursday, an upper level trough is forecast to dig across the 
Four Corners region, slowly meandering east across the southern 
plains towards the Mid-MS Valley through the weekend. To the north, 
a weaker northern stream wave will pass east across the Upper MS 
Valley later Thursday into Friday with little in the way of precip
expected locally. The 25.12Z EPS showed only a ~10% probability 
of at least 0.01" of rain westward approaching the I-35 corridor.
Have maintained a dry forecast.

Otherwise, a split flow pattern will remain in place into early next 
week with the stronger westerlies across southern Canada and surface 
high pressure in place from the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes 
through the start of the weekend. Global ensembles show small 
temperature spread late this week through early next week with 
gradually warming highs through the 50s and 60s expected. Right 
now most guidance favors continued dry weather through the weekend
with any precip with the southern stream low pressure system 
likely staying south at this time.

.AVIATION...(For the 12Z TAFS through 12Z Thursday morning)
Issued at 546 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Surface high pressure scoots over the forecast area today
providing mostly clear conditions with winds veering southerly 
this evening. A lower (3-5kft) stratus deck lingers in western 
Wisconsin into central Minnesota this morning. Forecast models 
have not handled this well. Based on lack of progression 
overnight, have not introduced in either TAF site at this time.
