Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Spokane WA
313 AM PDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS....
An active weather pattern will deliver several opportunities for
precipitation through the weekend into early next week. Gusty
winds are also expected on Thursday and again Sunday into Monday.
Seasonably cool temperatures are expected through the weekend with
cooler than average temperatures possible by the middle of next
week including a good chance of widespread freezing temperatures.

.DISCUSSION...

Today and tomorrow:
Synoptic & mesoscale forced rain and mountain snow are ongoing in 
the Inland Northwest from a compact 500 mb shortwave moving through 
the central cascades. SPC mesoanalysis data shows DGZ depth over the 
region ranging from 700 to 900 meters. Current and recent estimates 
of DGZ omega over the Cascades ranging from -8 to -12 
microbars/second and DGZ RH have yielded 1"+ snowfall rates at 
Stevens Pass for a few hours. Stevens Pass webcams show a wet-
looking snow covering US-2 around 9 PM. Latest guidance shows an 
additional 1-3 inches of snow for Stevens Pass and 0.5-2 inches of 
snow for Washington Pass through 11 AM PDT. Amounts are higher at 
Stevens Pass due to the Puget Sound convergence zone (PSCZ) 
currently developing along US-2 through 10 AM PDT. Hi-res guidance 
shows lingering uncertainty where the PSCZ generates the highest 
snow totals. HRRR has the band between Snoqualmie Pass and Stevens 
Pass while the FV3 and ARW have the band in a more favored position 
for Stevens Pass. NAM-3km with a weak and disorganized PSCZ is an 
outlier given the current radar trends. The PSCZ will quickly fizzle 
and migrate northward and fizzle out by 12-2 PM PDT. A Winter 
Weather Advisory is valid for this area through 5 AM PDT and may be 
extended a few more hours depending on the evolution of the PSCZ. 
Snow levels appear to be above 4000 feet MSL at this time. 

Lee cyclogenesis has occurred with a broad surface low between Omak 
and east of Ephrata with pressures around 1008 mb. Radar shows light 
rain occurring north and east of the surface low. Elevations above 
4000 feet will see 2-5 inches of snow with this round of 
precipitation. Radar bright banding ongoing indicates mixed phase 
precipitation around 3000 ft MSL, so higher lowland elevations will 
see some snowflakes mixing in with the rain but no accumulation is 
expected below 4000 ft MSL. The cold front will traverse through 
Spokane County in the next few hours and exit north Idaho Wednesday 
later this morning and shower activity should linger in the 
orographic favored areas of extreme eastern WA into the Idaho 
Panhandle through the afternoon hours. Shortwave ridging will dry 
out most of the region tonight and tomorrow ahead of the next 
impulse. Drier westerly winds increase Wednesday afternoon and 
evening across the Columbia Basin into the Palouse and southeast 
Washington with gusts to 25 mph.

The next system is expected tomorrow afternoon into Friday morning. 
There is not a lot of moisture associated with the wave. The 
Northern Cascade Crests will see an additional few inches from this 
system. The lower elevations can expect breezy winds up to 30-35 mph 
with the passage of the system. DB

Friday and Saturday: There is good model agreement that the 
active Polar Jet over central and southern British Columbia on
Thursday will weaken and translate into central Canada by Friday
evening. A broad shield of light to moderate precipitation over
B.C. on Thursday will become less organized Friday into Saturday
as the plume of moisture moves south across Washington and Idaho.
Ensemble based guidance continues to forecast chances for
precipitation Friday and Saturday across the Inland Northwest, but
amounts look to be light as our jet dynamics and Integrated Water
Vapor Transport (IVT) weakens. What forcing that remains will be
largely orographic over the west slopes of the Cascades up to the
crest. Snow levels Friday and Saturday are expected to be in the 
5000-6000ft range. Washington Pass on Highway 20 in the north 
Cascades has an elevation of 5476 feet, and could receive some wet
accumulations Friday morning and again Friday night into Saturday
morning. Snow levels will likely be too high for meaningful 
accumulations at Stevens Pass. Friday and Saturday should be 
mainly cloudy region-wide with high temperatures mainly in the 
50s.

Sunday and Monday: A broad trough translating across the Gulf of
Alaska will re-energize the Polar Jet Sunday into Monday and focus
a plume of moisture into the Pacific Northwest. The west to east
orientation of the mid and upper level flow will deliver the most
significant precipitation over the mountainous terrain. Snow
levels on Sunday will generally be above pass levels in the
Cascades and Idaho Panhandle (5500 to 6500 feet). Look for snow
levels to fall Monday and Tuesday as the Gulf of Alaska trough
migrates inland leading to a good chance of accumulating snow
Monday night into Tuesday. Sunday and Monday has the potential to
become windy. At this time, the surface pressure gradient favors
gusty southwest winds Sunday afternoon, Sunday night, and most of
Monday. This direction favors the strongest gusts across the West
Plains, Spokane area, and the exposed ridges of northeast
Washington and far north Idaho. ECMWF ensemble guidance suggests
sustained winds of 20 to 25 mph with gusts up to 40 mph for these
areas. Winds of this magnitude occur several times per year and 
have the potential to produce minor tree damage.

Tuesday and Wednesday: There is a good deal of ensemble spread
during the early to middle part of next week. A significant
percentage of ensembles forecast the arrival of cooler Canadian
air. The National Blend of Models advertises widespread high
temperatures in the 40s by Wednesday with widepsread freezing
temperatures Tuesday night with much of eastern Washington and
north Idaho dipping into the mid to upper 20s...a hard freeze for
Spokane, Pullman, Colville, Sandpoint, and the Silver Valley.

.AVIATION... 
06Z TAFS: Valley rain and mountain snow will spread across 
eastern Washington and into the Idaho Panhandle into early 
Wednesday morning. Ceilings will lower across all airports with 
marginal VFR and localized IFR conditions expected over extreme 
eastern Washington and the Idaho Panhandle by midnight tonight. 
Precipitaiton will transition to showers over the Idaho Panhandle 
Wednesday afternoon with ceilings slowly lifting. Confidence is 
lower for VFR conditions to develop by the afternoon in the 
Panhandle becoming high over the Columbia Basin. /SVH
