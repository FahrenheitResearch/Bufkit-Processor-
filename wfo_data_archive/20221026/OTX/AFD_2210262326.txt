Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Spokane WA
426 PM PDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS....
An active weather pattern will deliver several chances of 
precipitation through the weekend into early next week. Gusty 
winds are also expected on Thursday, and again Sunday into early 
Monday. Seasonable temperatures are expected through the weekend, 
with cooler than average temperatures possible by the middle of 
next week, including a good chance of widespread freezing 
temperatures in the morning hours.

.DISCUSSION...
Tonight through Friday night: Trof with its limited conditionally 
unstable air allowing light showers to linger over the North Idaho 
and extreme Eastern Washington should be moved out to the southeast 
and allowing a positively tilted ridge tonight with a more stable 
atmosphere to take its place resulting in a generally dry forecast 
heading into Thursday. An exception will be within close proximity of 
the Cascade Crest as some spillover might occur with the more active 
zonal flow to the west of the Cascades heading into Thursday. 
Another weather system sags a southwest to northeast oriented 
moisture plume across Eastern Washington and North Idaho starting 
late Thursday night. This orientation favors a substantial rain 
shadow between the lee of the Cascade Crest, so substantial in fact 
that little if any precipitation may occur over the Idaho Panhandle 
and higher terrain of Northeast Washington during this period with 
the plume weakening as it moves through. Forecast temps show a 
warming trend through the remainder of the workweek. There is a 
tendency for more gusty low level Southerly/southwest winds, 
especially Thursday with the flattening out of the ridge resulting 
in closer proximity of the jet stream and hints of a surface low 
passing from west to east within close proximity of the British 
Columbia Border.

Saturday and Sunday: Ensemble solutions are in good agreement for
the first half of the weekend and keep energetic westerly flow 
poised over southern BC. This should keep most of the region dry 
however with westerly winds in the lower portions of the 
atmosphere. However residual moisture from Friday nights front 
should keep some light orographic precipitation in the forecast 
near the Cascade Crest and over the ID Panhandle. With the jet 
being well to our north, we should see mild temperatures with 
highs generally in the 50s in the valleys. By Sunday, the jet will
begin sagging south toward the region which will begin to 
introduce a weak atmospheric river with precipitable water values 
increasing to 160-190 percent of normal. The weak river will 
continue to sag slowly south through Monday. The incoming river is
expected to deliver a steady increase in the chances of 
precipitation from NW to SE across the region. However, since the 
mid-level flow will remain primarily out of the west, we will 
continue to see a well-defined rain shadow in the lee of the 
Cascades. Total precipitation amounts from Sunday into Monday will
range from 1-1.5” near the Cascade Crest to 0.25-0.60” over the 
Panhandle. Meanwhile over the Columbia Basin precipitation amounts
will be less than an tenth of an inch. Based on the relatively 
mild temperatures before the onset of the precipitation, snow 
should not be a major issue. The snow levels will generally be 
5000’ or higher before the moisture arrives and won’t fall until 
the passage of the atmospheric river and associated cold front. 
Consequently we don’t expect this to impact most of our mountain 
passes, with the possible exception of Washington Pass where snow 
totals could range from 6-12 inches. However the NBM forecasts 
lately have generally over forecast the snow amounts and can’t 
help but think this trend will continue. While most areas won’t 
see snow, many valley locations should be subject to increasing 
winds. 850 mb winds ahead of the upcoming system could range from 
35-45 knots extending from the Dalles to Spokane, and once the 
cold air advection sets in behind the cold front there’s a chance 
some of these winds could mix down to the ground. There are timing
differences at this point, but many of the ensembles are hinting 
that this will occur either late Sunday or early Monday and should
not interfere with Halloween trick or treat activities. 

Tuesday and Wednesday...The weather for these days looks decidedly
cooler as the upper level jet sags well to our south with an upper
level trough digging in across the region. The 850 mb temperatures
will likely drop below 0c over most of the Inland NW which should
equate to high temperatures only in the 40s and overnight lows
dipping well below freezing. Although it doesn’t look terribly wet
during this period, the presence of the trough suggests we could
see the development of showers due to deep instability over the
entire region, weak forcing from the trough, and some orographic
ascent over the mountains. Snow levels by this point could drop to
the valley floors at most locations at least during the overnight
and early morning hours. fx

.AVIATION... 
00Z TAFS: Showers will dissipate over over NE WA/ID this evening
with a weak passing the region and exiting by morning. Primarily
VFR conditions expected, except in the vcnty of showers where lcl
MVFR cigs are possible. Going into early morning some MVFR low
clouds are expected to develop near GEG/SFF/COE, largely between
about 11-18Z. Otherwise look for some middle to high clouds and 
minor gusty winds Thursday afternoon. /Cote'
