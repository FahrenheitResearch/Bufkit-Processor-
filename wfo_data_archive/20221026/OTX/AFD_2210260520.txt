.DISCUSSION...
Through tonight: A potent shortwave is making its way across western 
Washington this afternoon. A band of high level wave clouds are 
pushing across eastern WA while southerly winds have kicked up to 
25 mph across the clear slot of central WA. These winds should 
subside by mid evening while clouds quickly fill in with the 
approaching shortwave. Radar shows precipitation almost to the 
west slopes of the Cascades which will spill to the eastern slopes
by late afternoon and spread across the Inland NW overnight. With
snow levels near 4K ft, valleys will see rain while wet sloppy 
snow returns to the higher mountains. Bursts of mountain snow is 
possible with the conditionally unstable air mass. The main brunt 
will be the northern WA mountain passes, including Washington and 
Stevens Passes where 5 to 9 inches of snow will be found. A Winter
Weather Advisory has been issued for this area through the night.
Anticipate a 6-12 hour period of light to moderate precipitation 
as this shortwave and associated cold front passes across the 
Inland Northwest overnight. 

Wednesday through Wednesday night: The cold front will exit north
Idaho Wednesday morning and shower activity should linger in the
orographic favored areas of extreme eastern WA into the Idaho
Panhandle through the afternoon hours. Mountain snow continues
while light amounts are anticipated from Lookout Pass to the Camas
Prairie. Drier westerly winds increase Wednesday afternoon and
evening across the Columbia Basin into the Palouse and southeast
Washington with gusts to 25 mph. Little change in daytime
temperatures is expected from Tuesday into Wednesday, still a few
degrees below normal. By Wednesday evening, convection and winds
gradually subside. With the another weather system approaching,
skies should remain overcast with light mountain snow returning to
the northern Cascades and Selkirks late. Wednesday night lows look
to cool below freezing in many areas, especially across the
northern valleys of Washington and the Idaho Panhandle. /rfox. 

Thursday through Tuesday: The region will continue to under the 
train of cool, wet systems. They will continue to bring periods of 
mountain snow. For the valleys and low lying areas, the first part 
the period will mainly be rain. By the the start of next week, the 
trends start to show more snow potential leading to rain-snow mix. 
The Cascades will continue to receive the brunt of these systems and 
receive the higher precip amounts.

The first system is expected Thursday afternoon into Friday morning. 
There is not a lot of moisture associated with the wave. The Cascade 
Crest area can expected a possible inch or two. The lower elevations 
can expect breezy winds with the passage. Ensembles are showing 
gusts into the upper 20s. 

There will be a break in systems late Friday and Saturday. The next 
one will arrive early Sunday morning. Models are showing decent 
agreement on it bringing decent precip amounts to the mountain 
areas. Snow levels will also be rising. It could affect the how much 
snow falls for the passes. But travelers should expect impacts over 
these areas through Monday. It will have a tighter pressure gradient 
across the Basin bringing stronger winds for Monday. Gusts are 
expected to reach into the 30s and possibly low 40 mph range. It 
will also pull decent cold air from the North and bring a cooling 
trend to the region for Tuesday.

For temperatures, highs will be in the 40s and low 50s for most 
through the period with temperatures dipping a few degrees by 
Tuesday. Lows will generally be in the 30s with some upper 20s in 
the higher terrain. By Tuesday, northern valleys are starting to dip 
into the upper 20s. /JDC
