.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 255 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Quiet weather is in store for our area today and tonight. The 
flow aloft over our area will be zonal today, and become southwest
by Thursday morning, as an upper trough over the Pacific 
Northwest moves southeast into the central Rockies to near the 
Four Corners area. After a chilly start to the day, with strong 
insolation and increasing south winds, temperatures will rebound 
into the mid 70s to near 80 for highs this afternoon. Skies will 
be generally clear tonight, and temperatures will not be as cool. 
Overnight lows are expected to range mostly from the upper 40s in 
our eastern and southeastern counties, to lower 50s in the western
half of the area.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 351 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The main concern in the long term forecast will be the potential
for strong to severe thunderstorms Thursday night into Friday
morning. An upper level low will move southeast toward the area
from the Four Corners region on Thursday. As it approaches, breezy 
south winds responding to surface low pressure in southeastern 
CO/northeastern NM will help advect low level moisture into the 
area. As the low approaches Thursday evening, largescale lift will
increase, and a cold front will sweep through from west to east 
providing a focus for storms to develop off of. Thunderstorms are 
expected to increase in coverage during the evening hours, 
eventually forming a broken line of storms that will move through 
west central Texas. Instability will be enhanced due to the cold 
temperatures aloft associated with the upper low. Combined with 
increasing winds aloft, some of the storms that develop may be 
severe, with the main hazards being large hail and damaging winds.
While most areas should see at least some precipitation, the best
chance for significant rainfall is expected along and north of a 
Sterling City to San Saba line.

Showers and a few thunderstorms may linger into Friday afternoon,
especially east of a line from Sweetwater to Junction. After highs
in the 70s to near 80 on Thursday, temperatures will be quite a 
bit cooler Friday, with highs only in the mid 50s to upper 60s.
Quiet weather with slowly warming temperatures will follow from
Saturday through early next week.
