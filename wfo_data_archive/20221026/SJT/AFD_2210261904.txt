.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 154 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Zonal flow aloft will leave quiet weather in place for the
remainder of today and tonight. However, the forecast becomes a
bit more tricky towards the end of the forecast period on Thursday
afternoon as both the GFS and ECMWF indicate a strong low pressure
system moving in aloft. We may see a brief period of scattered
thunderstorms out ahead of the approaching disturbance. As a 
result, a 20 to 30 percent chance of rain has been included in the
forecast for the Big Country. However, the bulk of the activity 
is expected to occur after 7 PM (overnight Thursday night and 
Friday morning). If the system speeds up, then we may see a bit 
higher coverage earlier than 7 PM. For now, the best chances will 
remain later on Thursday night and Friday morning. The Storm 
Prediction Center does have a Marginal Risk for severe weather on
Day 2, which is when this activity rolls through. The primary 
hazards are large hail and damaging winds at this time.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 351 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The main concern in the long term forecast will be the potential
for strong to severe thunderstorms Thursday night into Friday
morning. An upper level low will move southeast toward the area
from the Four Corners region on Thursday. As it approaches, breezy 
south winds responding to surface low pressure in southeastern 
CO/northeastern NM will help advect low level moisture into the 
area. As the low approaches Thursday evening, largescale lift will
increase, and a cold front will sweep through from west to east 
providing a focus for storms to develop off of. Thunderstorms are 
expected to increase in coverage during the evening hours, 
eventually forming a broken line of storms that will move through 
west central Texas. Instability will be enhanced due to the cold 
temperatures aloft associated with the upper low. Combined with 
increasing winds aloft, some of the storms that develop may be 
severe, with the main hazards being large hail and damaging winds.
While most areas should see at least some precipitation, the best
chance for significant rainfall is expected along and north of a 
Sterling City to San Saba line.

Showers and a few thunderstorms may linger into Friday afternoon,
especially east of a line from Sweetwater to Junction. After highs
in the 70s to near 80 on Thursday, temperatures will be quite a 
bit cooler Friday, with highs only in the mid 50s to upper 60s.
Quiet weather with slowly warming temperatures will follow from
Saturday through early next week.
