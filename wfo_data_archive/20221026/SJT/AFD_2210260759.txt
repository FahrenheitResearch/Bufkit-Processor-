Quiet weather is in store for our area today and tonight. The

Northwest moves southeast into the central Rockies to near the 
Four Corners area. After a chilly start to the day, with strong 
insolation and increasing south winds, temperatures will rebound 
into the mid 70s to near 80 for highs this afternoon. Skies will be 
generally clear tonight, and temperatures will not be as cool. 
Overnight lows are expected to range mostly from the upper 40s in 
our eastern and southeastern counties, to lower 50s in the western 
half of the area.
