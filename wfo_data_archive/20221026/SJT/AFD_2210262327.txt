.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 154 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Zonal flow aloft will leave quiet weather in place for the
remainder of today and tonight. However, the forecast becomes a
bit more tricky towards the end of the forecast period on Thursday
afternoon as both the GFS and ECMWF indicate a strong low pressure
system moving in aloft. We may see a brief period of scattered
thunderstorms out ahead of the approaching disturbance. As a 
result, a 20 to 30 percent chance of rain has been included in the
forecast for the Big Country. However, the bulk of the activity 
is expected to occur after 7 PM (overnight Thursday night and 
Friday morning). If the system speeds up, then we may see a bit 
higher coverage earlier than 7 PM. For now, the best chances will 
remain later on Thursday night and Friday morning. The Storm 
Prediction Center does have a Marginal Risk for severe weather on
Day 2, which is when this activity rolls through. The primary 
hazards are large hail and damaging winds at this time.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through next Tuesday)
Issued at 208 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Strong upper level low over New Mexico will eject eastward into
west Texas on Friday and move across the Big Country/northern 
Concho Valley during the morning/afternoon. The attendant Pacific
front will sweep across the entire area during the overnight
hours. Large scale lift will increase as the aforementioned upper
low approaches. Scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms 
are forecast to develop out to our west along the front and 
eventually congeal into a squall line. High res model guidance
(HRRR, NAMNEST. Texas Tech WRF) are all on board with this
scenario, showing a broken band of showers and thunderstorms
moving into our western counties around midnight and then sweeping
eastward through the entire area through the morning hours. As
mentioned in the short term discussion. SPC does have our entire
area highlighted in a marginal risk for severe weather. Given
modest instability, steep lapse rates aloft, and effective shear
greater than 40 knots, strong to severe storms are possible. The
primary threat at this time is damaging winds especially if a
squall line were to develop, but large hail is also possible given
the steep lapse rates aloft. 

Rain chances will continue into the afternoon and evening hours 
especially across the northern half of the area as the upper level
low moves almost directly overhead. The system finally moves off
to the east Friday night with high pressure building in its wake.
Temperatures will be cool on Friday given abundant cloud cover and
expected rains. Highs will only be in the 50s in the Big Country
and in the 60s elsewhere. The weekend looks dry and pleasant with
temperatures warming back up into the 70s by Sunday.

(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 627 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Generally VFR conditions expected with light winds overnight.
Southerly winds will increase by midday with gusts near 20 at
times. Some MVFR ceilings possible along I-10 through the 
afternoon. A few showers or thunderstorms are also possible after
18Z, but these were left out of the TAFs due to low confidence.
