.LONG TERM...
(Tomorrow through Wednesday)
Issued at 218 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A shortwave over the northwestern U.S. will dive into west Texas
by early Friday and close off into a low during the process.  The GFS
has adjusted north at 12Z and is more inline with ensemble clusters.  
The ECMWF and NAM are also similar.  The low will track into southern
Arkansas on Saturday.    

A few showers could develop in parts of northeast Oklahoma late Thursday.
The rain chances will expand into eastern Oklahoma Thursday night, with 
the best chances in our western Counties.  On Friday, the rain chances
are best in southeast Oklahoma and southwest Arkansas, with chances
extending north across northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas.

An isolated thunderstorm or two will be possible from Friday night into
Saturday from far southeast Oklahoma into parts of northwest Arkansas.  
A half inch to an inch and a half of rain is forecast from southeast
Oklahoma into parts of northwest Arkansas.  A local amount or two near
two inches appears possible.

That system will clear the area on Sunday, with no precipitation expected
from Sunday through Tuesday.  Seasonably mild temperatures are expected
to continue, warm some early next week.
