Overall, it looks like a quiet night across eastern Oklahoma and
northwest Arkansas, with cooler and drier in place in the wake of
the upper low now in the mid-Mississippi Valley region. Expect
clear skies and much lighter winds overnight, along with below
normal low temperatures. The only notable change to the going
forecast has been to lower wind speeds and gusts overnight across
parts of northwest Arkansas. Otherwise, things look on track. Have
a good evening.

(Tomorrow through Tuesday)
Issued at 218 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Ensemble data suggests that the next upper-low that is to head into the 
southern U.S. may trend a little slower and a little stronger than 
some model data.  Rain chances will start late Thursday in Osage and 
Pawnee Counties and from there expand into the rest of eastern Oklahoma
Thursday night.  If the upper-low does trend a little slower, then
the rain chances may delayed a bit.  This system will likely take
a more southern track as compared to the system today.  That would place
the higher rain potential in southeast Oklahoma and western Arkansas from
Friday into Saturday.
