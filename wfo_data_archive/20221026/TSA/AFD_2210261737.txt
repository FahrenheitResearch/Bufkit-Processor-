.SHORT TERM...
(Today)
Issued at 323 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Sfc ridge axis extending through the region today will yield 
pleasant fall conditions area wide.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tonight through Tuesday)
Issued at 323 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Wave currently moving ashore the Pacific Northwest will amplify as
it drops southwestward with a well defined closed mid level low
forecast across west TX by Friday morning. Winds increase
Thursday in advance of the wave, while moistening mid level 
profiles support high based showers nearing NE OK late Thursday. 
Rain chances will gradually spread east and southward Thursday 
night however the bulk of heavier rains will remain further west. 

Guidance is in generally good agreement on the track of the upper 
low across north central TX Friday and then northeastward through 
AR by Saturday night. A notable gradient in rain chances will 
exist across the forecast area Friday through Saturday with 
highest chances across SE OK and far western AR and much lower 
chances northward across NE OK. This same general precip coverage 
pattern will also align with areas receiving higher rainfall 
totals. Cloudy and cool Friday and Saturday with a warm up early 
next week and temps likely back above normal by mid next week.
