.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Thursday night)
Issued at 238 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Currently, there are some clouds that are hanging around the 
southeast Rio Grande Valley. These clouds are not expected to 
bring any rain with them. Rain chances pick around Thursday night,
more on that later. Winds will be mostly light and easterly. Low 
temperatures for tonight are expected to be around upper 50's to 
60's. It is possible that our temperatures overnight may be warmer
depending on when the cloud deck builds in.

Getting into Thursday, some of the clouds that form the night before 
might stick around into the morning, which would lessen the warming 
of temperatures in the morning. However, our highs are still 
expected to be in the low 80's. Winds will shift from easterly to 
southeasterly during the day.

Thursday night, we will start to see rain chances start to increase 
ahead of a trough that will be moving into North Texas that will be 
moving into the Deep South Texas and Rio Grande Valley. This trough 
movement will coincide with Gulf moisture moving into the area with 
the southeasterly winds. The trough will be providing some lift that 
will help showers and thunderstorms develop. Greatest chances of 
rain will occur along the coastal counties with isolated to 
scattered showers and thunderstorms. Low temperatures are expected 
to be in the upper 60's to low 70's.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through next Wednesday)
Issued at 238 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A 500 low developing over the Northern Rockies will dive 
southeastward into northwest Texas by Friday morning. As this system 
moves eastward during the day on Friday it will bring a cold front 
through Deep South Texas. The front will likely make its way through 
the County Warning Area (CWA) during the day on Friday and 
through the coastal waters Friday evening/night.
  
Just ahead and along the front, excess moisture will allow 
precipitation chances to continue Friday morning into the early 
afternoon. Rainfall amounts on Friday will likely be in the 0.1 to 
0.25 inch range mainly east of I-69C, though some heavier rainfall 
amounts are possible, especially with any heavier thunderstorm 
activity. Once the front moves through, precipitation chances 
will taper off west to east as drier air filters in. Along with 
drier air in wake of the front, northwesterly winds will increase 
and remain elevated along the coast into Saturday. 

Temperatures will remain near normal on Friday and while there will 
be somewhat limited cold air advection with the next frontal 
passage, daytime highs on Saturday 5 to 10 degrees cooler than 
Friday and overnight lows friday and Saturday, generally in the 50s. 
Zonal to southwesterly low returns for the later part of the weekend 
with temperatures gradually warming up and returning to the near 
normal by Wednesday. A weak trough will move through Texas Tuesday 
and Wednesday increasing chances of precipitation Tuesday into early 
Wednesday.

.MARINE...
Issued at 238 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Tonight through Thursday Night...Surface high pressure will hold 
over the northern Gulf for most of the period with favorable marine 
conditions. Winds will stay easterly before turning more 
southeasterly overnight and into Thursday. Seas at this time will be 
around 2 to 4 feet. Going into Thursday night, winds will start to 
increase to where Small Craft might need to exercise caution on the 
Gulf waters as winds will be around 15 to 18 knots and waves around 
4 to 5 feet. Isolated to scattered showers are possible Thursday 
night.

Friday through Sunday...Slightly adverse marine conditions are 
expected to start the period as a cold front begins to move through 
Deep South Texas. By Friday afternoon/evening Small Craft Advisories 
are likely across the Laguna Madre and Gulf waters as the 
aforementioned front moves through the coastal waters with elevated 
winds and seas in its wake, especially in the overnight hours. 
Gradual improvement is expected Saturday afternoon into Sunday as 
winds and seas lower.
