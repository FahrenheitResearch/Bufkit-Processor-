.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 352 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The most interesting thing to start the short term are the clouds
at about 7000 to 9000 feet that have lifted in from Mexico for 
areas along the Rio Grande River. The GFS is really the only model
showing a somewhat saturated layer (80%+ relative humidity) 
between 800 to 700 mb this morning, so have used that for the 
cloud coverage through early afternoon. Of course, with these 
unexpected clouds, temperatures have actually climbed a few 
degrees at sites underneath the cloud deck in the last few hours, 
so have adjusted temperatures through 12Z (7AM) accordingly. Now 
the question becomes: Do these clouds filter out with the help of 
daytime heating? Yes, they should. However, I'll be honest and say
it's not a guarantee. Since the GFS has handled this morning's 
clouds the best, and keeps them around into the early afternoon, I
have used a bit of GFS for temperatures later today. That would 
put much of the region into the lower to middle 80s this 
afternoon. Of course, if the clouds hold tougher than currently 
thought then some areas may not hit 80. So, what a fun forecast to
start! (That last sentence may or may not be soaked with 
sarcasm...)

No rain is expected from these clouds as the saturated layer is only 
a few thousand feet, so not nearly enough to allow droplets to grow 
large enough to fall. Rain chances aren't forecast to increase until 
Thursday afternoon as southeasterly winds pump in more moisture from 
the south. Combine that with a weak coastal trough lifting north 
along the coast and an isolated shower or storm is possible Thursday 
afternoon for areas east of I-69E/US-77. Even then, rain chances 
remain near 20% at this time. 

Have already chatted about temperatures for today, but what about 
tonight? Well, winds turning southeasterly are forecast to keep 
temperatures a solid 5 to 7 degrees warmer than tonight along with 
higher dew points. That would put most of the area in the middle 60s 
outside of the Northern Ranchlands, where a few spots are still 
forecast to dip into the upper 50s. Also, models indicate the 
potential for another cloud deck arriving at 900 to 800 mb tonight, 
which could further limit cooling. As for Thursday, a southeasterly 
flow will be entrenched, as temperatures climb into the lower to 
middle 80s once again. Of course, clouds and the coastal trough may 
have a different say in the matter.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 352 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

00Z Model guidance are in good agreement and consistency with the
next storm system moving into north Texas and ushering in our 
next cold front Friday. After this system passes to the east fair 
and tranquil weather is expected for the weekend and Monday with a
much weaker system and another chance of rain next Tuesday. 

Rain chances increase quite dramatically Thursday night into Friday 
as moisture advection increases in advance of an mid/upper trough 
diving SE out of the Rockies and into North Texas. The trough 
evolves into a closed low as its slowly tracks across Texas. The 
associated cold front works its way southeast moving across the CWA 
Friday morning/early afternoon and through the coastal waters Friday 
evening. With the latest projections showing an increase in pwats of 
1.5 to 1.75+ inches and the atmosphere becoming quite unstable 
convection, potentially strong, is anticipated to quickly develop 
Thursday night with chances becoming rather high in advance of the 
frontal passage Friday. The frontal passage will be very similar to 
Tuesday's with drier air, breezy to windy conditions and limited 
cold air advection later Friday and Saturday. Zonal to Southwest 
flow develops Sunday through Tuesday with gradual warming 
temperatures along with increasing moisture ending with another shot 
of rain Tuesday as a weak trough enters west Texas. 

Temperatures guidances is above normal for both lows and highs 
Thursday and Friday before falling below normal Saturday into Sunday 
morning. Temperatures than trend upward Sunday through Tuesday as 
mid-level flow veer west-southwest.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1210 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions prevail through the period. Light and variable
winds continue through mid-morning on Wednesday before freshening
out of the east by the afternoon.

.MARINE...
Issued at 352 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Today through Thursday...Surface high pressure dominates the 
northern Gulf of Mexico and will continue to provide favor marine 
conditions through the period. Winds turn easterly later today 
before turning southeasterly tonight into Thursday. Seas will 
generally run 2 to 4 feet. 

Thursday through Sunday...Southerly flow increases Thursday 
night into Friday morning as a deepening storm system moves into 
north Texas. Small Craft advisories are likely as winds near 20 
knots and seas respond accordingly. The cold front associated with 
the storm system moves through the coastal waters Friday afternoon 
with the pressure gradient tightening into Saturday as a surface low 
is shown to develop over SW Louisiana. Adverse marine conditions, 
especially for the Gulf waters will persist through Saturday with 
slow improvement Saturday night and Sunday.
