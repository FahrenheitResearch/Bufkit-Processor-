.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Thursday night)
Issued at 331 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Key Messages:

  - Dry & pleasant tonight through early Thursday morning

  - Moisture increases in advance of a cold front, leading to slight 
rain chances returning as early as Thursday afternoon, increasing 
overnight.

Tonight and early Thursday morning will be relatively quiet with 
quasi-zonal flow aloft and winds weak out of the northeast. However, 
surface winds will shift onshore and lead to a significant increase 
in moisture. PWATs will quickly climb from around an inch in the 
morning to around 1.5" (75th percentile) in the afternoon. CAM 
guidance is showing showers developing across the southern CWA 
Thursday afternoon with this enhanced moisture. Have included a 
slight mention of showers for this area. 

Coverage with the addition of thunderstorms will increase to 
scattered overnight as the 925mb LLJ strengthens, enhancing lift 
support ahead of an approaching cold front, and bands of positive 
vorticity (500-850mb) advects across the area. Greatest coverage is 
most favorable around the Coastal Bend, Victoria Crossroads and the 
waters where PWATs are even projected to be greater, near 1.75" 
(greater than 75th percentile). 

The NBM 24-hr Probability of QPF ending 7AM Friday greater than 0.1" 
is showing 30-50% across most of the area with greater than 0.5" at 
15% or less. Therefore, not expecting significant rain accumulation 
through Thursday night. It is worth mentioning that NBM ProbQPF of 
measurable rain amounts (>0.01") is 40-75% with greatest chances 
along the coast and Victoria Crossroads (area previously mentioned). 

Tonight's lows will be in the mid 60s near the coast to the mid 50s 
inland. Highs on Thursday will generally be in the low 80s across 
the region. The increase in cloud and rain cover Thursday night will 
prohibit radiational cooling and lead to warmer lows, ranging from 
the mid 60s to lower 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through next Tuesday)
Issued at 331 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The aforementioned surface cold front is forecast to progress 
southeastward through the CWA Friday morning. While the timing of 
the frontal passage will limit destabilization, model guidance is 
indicating that 1000-1500 J/kg of CAPE will develop ahead of the 
cold front. Therefore, there will be the potential for thunderstorms 
to accompany the frontal passage. Forecast cloud layer winds and 
vertical wind shear vectors will be oriented around 45 degrees with 
respect to the orientation of cold front will support the potential 
for some cellular convective modes. Therefore, there is a Marginal 
Risk of severe weather on Friday (5%-14% chance of occurring within 
25 miles of a point) with the main hazard being damaging wind gusts. 

Northwest winds of 15-20 MPH with gusts to around 30 MPH are 
forecast to develop behind the front Friday afternoon. These 
stronger winds could briefly overlap with relative humidity around 
30% across the Rio Grande Plains later Friday afternoon. However, 
near to above normal moisture in grass and brush across that area 
will limit a large concern for fires before winds decrease Friday 
evening.

Quiet weather is then expected through the rest of long term period 
with high pressure gradually building eastward.

(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 608 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Generally VFR conditions are expected to persist across area
terminals through the cycle. However, increased moisture over the
region on Thursday may bring lower ceilings that could potentially
lead to MVFR conditions and patchy showers across the sites. For
now though, have withheld from adding these into the TAFs owing 
to lower confidence on timing, but could see them added in later 
packages. Winds will be light out of the east tonight, shifting to
the southeast and becoming gusty at times on Thursday ahead of an
approaching boundary.

.MARINE...
Issued at 331 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Weak to moderate northeasterly flow this afternoon will shift
southeasterly and become weak tonight. Weak to moderate onshore
flow Thursday morning will strengthen to moderate Thursday
afternoon into early Friday morning. Showers and thunderstorms 
will accompany a cold front that will move through the coastal 
waters late Friday morning through Friday afternoon. Winds will 
increase Friday evening behind the front with a 70-90% chance of 
sustained winds greater than 22 knots over the coastal waters 
between Friday and Saturday evening. Gale conditions are not 
expected with a less than a 15% probability of wind gusts 
exceeding 34 knots. Therefore, expect Small Craft Advisories will 
be needed for all of the coastal waters a period between Friday 
afternoon and Saturday evening.

Winds and seas are forecast to decrease Saturday evening as high 
pressure builds into the region. High pressure will result in winds 
generally 10 knots or less and seas of 2 feet or less through 
Monday. Winds are expected to become southeasterly and increase to 
around 15 knots during the middle of next week in response to a area 
of low pressure developing in the Central to Northern Plains.
