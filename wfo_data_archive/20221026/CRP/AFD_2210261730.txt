.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 337 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Quiet weather continues through the short term period as surface
ridge shifts from the central plains to the northeast US over the
next day and a half. Mid-level quasi zonal flow is expected today,
becoming more southwesterly tomorrow  over the area as troughing 
digs through the Rockies. Moisture levels remain low today which
will keep us under mainly clear skies through the day with high
temperatures in the 70s and lower 80s. By tonight, winds shift 
more easterly and we'll see a gradual increase in moisture with 
low temperatures 5-10 degrees cooler than we are seeing this 
morning. Expect more clouds in the area tomorrow which will keep 
temps again mainly in the lower 80s. By late in the day tomorrow 
we could have enough moisture for an isolated shower, but most 
guidance hold off rain chances until Thursday night, and will 
agree with that.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through next Tuesday)
Issued at 337 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Rain chances return to South Texas Thursday night through 
Friday ahead of the next cold front.

The chance for showers and thunderstorms increase across S TX as a 
deep cut off low approaches the area from the northwest and brings a 
cold front into S TX. PWATs are progged to increase to 1.5 inches 
Thursday night and up to 1.8 inches across the eastern portions of 
the CWA Friday morning ahead of the front. The environment is 
progged to be moderately unstable, mainly eastern areas, along with 
strong low level convergence and upper level diffluence with RRQ of 
the upper jet moving across the region. The forecast soundings 
indicate that most of the moisture will be in the lower levels with 
drier mid/upper levels Thursday night, but does moisten up into the 
upper levels just ahead and along the front. Therefore, am expecting 
mainly showers and a few thunderstorms will initially develop 
Thursday night across the eastern CWA where the instability, deeper 
moisture and coastal convergence will be located. Then, increasing 
thunderstorm activity is expected as the cold front pushes through 
the area Friday morning.

Rain chances end from northwest to southeast as drier and cooler air 
filters into the area in the wake of the cold front through Friday 
afternoon. In addition, breezy northwest winds are progged to 
develop through Friday afternoon as high pressure builds across the 
region. 

Brief elevated fire danger conditions will be possible across the 
Rio Grande plains Friday afternoon as RH levels fall to near 30 
percent and northwest winds increase to 15 to 25 mph.

Sunny days and clear nights along with mild temperatures are 
expected over the weekend. A generally weak to moderate northerly 
wind will prevail before becoming onshore once again by Monday. The 
onshore flow will lead to warming temperatures and increasing 
humidity as well as a slight chance of convection by Tuesday along 
the coast and over the coastal waters.

(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1224 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions will prevail through majority of the the TAF
period. There are currently FEW-SCT mid to upper level clouds 
over the Brush Country and Rio Grande Plains that is expected to 
dissipate through the day today. Winds will be generally light 
with sustained around 10 knots or less this afternoon with gusts 
around 20 knots for CRP. Winds will diminish overnight and shift 
more southeasterly tomorrow morning. Could see borderline MVFR 
ceilings near the end of the period, especially out west along the
Rio Grande where an enhanced moisture axis is predicted to 
develop.

.MARINE...
Issued at 337 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Weak to moderate northeast today winds will shift more easterly 
tonight and Thursday. By Thursday night, flow will increase to
moderate levels out of the southeast. Scattered showers and 
thunderstorms are possible in the coastal waters. Scattered to 
numerous showers and thunderstorms are expected Friday ahead of 
the next cold front. Rain chances decrease through Friday 
afternoon behind the cold front. Winds will become moderate 
offshore Friday and will increase to moderate to strong Friday 
night into Saturday before decreasing to weak to moderate levels 
Saturday night.
