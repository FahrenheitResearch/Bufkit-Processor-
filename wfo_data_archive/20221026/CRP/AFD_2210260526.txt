.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through next Monday)
Issued at 252 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Key Messages:

-Cold front will bring scattered to numerous showers and 
thunderstorms to the south Texas Thursday night into Friday

-Below normal temperatures expected this weekend

-Brief elevated fire danger conditions possible over Rio Grande 
Plains Friday afternoon

A positively tilted trough will approach the state Thursday night, 
becoming a closed low as it passes across north-central Texas early 
Friday. A cold front will be ejected subsequently into south Texas. 
Ahead of the front moisture will pool into the region with PWATs 
increasing to around 1.5". 

At this time expecting primarily showers to occur Thursday night 
into Friday morning. CAPE values will be around 2000 J/kg closer to 
the coast and into the Gulf Waters and 1000-1500 J/kg further 
inland. CIN values will be more elevated further inland, which will 
limit thunderstorm chances unless enough forcing occurs from the 
cold front. Best chances for thunderstorms will be along the Coastal 
Bend and across the Gulf Waters.

The atmosphere will quickly stabilize Friday afternoon behind the 
front as dry and cool air funnels in with weak to moderate northerly 
to northwesterly winds, leading to a quiet and cool weekend weather 
wise. Brief elevated fire danger conditions could develop over the 
Rio Grande Plains Friday afternoon as wind speeds increase to 
moderate levels and RH values decrease to around 30%.

Friday's highs will top out in the 70s to near 80, with further 
cooling taking place Saturday. Saturday's highs will generally be in 
the low to mid 60s. Mostly clear to clear skies on Friday and 
Saturday night will allow low temperatures to dip into the 40s and 
50s. 

Conditions will begin to warm on Sunday with highs in the upper 70s 
to low 80s.The warming trend will continue into early next week with 
highs increasing to the low to mid 80s.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1213 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Quiet aviation forecast tonight with VFR conditions throughout the
period. Winds will be light through the period, somewhat variable
overnight, but becoming a steady onshore flow during the day
Wednesday. There is a very small chance some fog could form toward
morning, but the potential is too low to include in TAFs at this
time.

.MARINE...
Issued at 252 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Moderate north winds will continue over the Gulf waters with SCEC
conditions over the offshore waters this evening. The moderate
winds will shift to northeast on Wednesday and could be SCEC
levels during the morning over the offshore waters. A weak to 
moderate easterly flow is expected Wednesday night.

Onshore flow will increase to moderate Thursday night with scattered 
showers and thunderstorms moving into the coastal waters. Scattered 
to numerous showers and storms are expected Friday ahead of the next 
cold front. Rain chances decrease through Friday afternoon behind 
the cold front. Winds will become moderate offshore Friday and 
increase to moderate to strong Friday night into Saturday morning.
