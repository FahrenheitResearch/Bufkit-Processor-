Fog continues across the region, with patches of dense fog in 
spots. This has resulted in reduced visibilities down to a few 
miles, with localized areas of a quarter mile or less. If dense
fog becomes more widespread, a Dense Fog Advisory may be needed.

Exercise caution if driving into early Wednesday morning and 
utilize your low beam headlights as visibilities may suddenly 
drop.
