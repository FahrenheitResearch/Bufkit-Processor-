Fog continues across the majority of the region this morning, 
with patches of dense fog in spots. This has resulted in reduced 
visibilities down to a mile, with localized areas of a quarter 
mile or less. 

Exercise caution if driving through the remainder of the morning 
and utilize your low beam headlights as visibilities may suddenly 
drop. Visibilities are expected to improve overall, albeit slowly
during the afternoon.
