...Areas of Dense Fog Developing Once Again Across Eastern
Virginia Early This Morning...

Areas of dense fog were developing once again this morning
generally along and east of U.S. 29 or generally along and east 
of a line from Lynchburg to South Boston. Visibilities in these
areas have dropped to less than one mile and some locations have
seen visibilities already drop to 1/4 mile or less. Fog will
continue across these areas overnight and early Wednesday morning
and will likely expand westward toward Danville, Bedford, and
Amherst as the night progresses. If conditions continue to worsen
and become more widespread, a Dense Fog Advisory may need to be
issued later this morning.

If you are planning travel early this morning, reduce speed, use low beam
headlights, leave extra distance between you and the vehicle in
front of you, and allow extra time to reach your destination.
