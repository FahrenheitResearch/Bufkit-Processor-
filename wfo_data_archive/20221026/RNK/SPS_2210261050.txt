...Areas of Dense Fog Developing Across Eastern Virginia Again 
Early This Morning...

Areas of dense fog had once again developed this morning generally
along and east of US 29 or generally along and east of a line 
from Lynchburg to South Boston. Visibilities in these areas were 
mostly in the 1/2 to 1 mile range, with a few spots seeing the 
visibility as low as 1/4 mile. Overall, conditions were not as bad
as what was observed Tuesday morning. Visibilities will begin to 
improve within the next couple of hours, but some areas may see 
dense fog persist until as late as 9 AM this morning.

If you are planning travel early this morning, reduce speed, use low beam
headlights, leave extra distance between you and the vehicle in
front of you, and allow extra time to reach your destination.
