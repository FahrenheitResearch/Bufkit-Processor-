Updated aviation discussion

.EVENING UPDATE...Water vapor imagery showing the upper trough
axis coming onshore the PacNW this late evening, with light rain
spreading east and north across the interior PacNW. Radar imagery
does show light rain echoes across the forecast area, however,
most of this is likely virga and not reaching the ground. That
said, some surface observations directly east of the Cascades have
reported some light precipitation occurring.

The upper trough will continue to push southeast across the PacNw
tonight, producing lower elevation rain and mountain snow across
eastern WA/OR. Snow levels tonight will be between 3kft to 4kft,
with a rain/snow mix possible within these elevations, while
the best snow ratios are anticipated in elevations 4.5kft and
higher. Snow accumulations tonight in elevations above 4kft in 
the Blues and Cascades are expected to be between 5 to 10 inches,
warranting Winter Weather Advisories in these areas tonight
through tomorrow afternoon. Otherwise, westerly winds are also 
expected to increase overnight and persist into tomorrow evening 
as the upper trough passes over the region. Updated PoPs to
account for current trends, and have increased winds slightly
across the forecast area, with rest of afternoon forecast package
on track. Lawhorn/82

.AVIATION...06Z TAFS...VFR conditions will prevail through the 
period. However, a weather system moving through the area this 
morning will produce light rain across the region.  Brief 
MVFR conditions could occur in areas of rainfall, especially 
KRDM and KBDN. Winds will be 10-20 kts with higher gusts.  Winds 
will decrease by early evening.  Earle

.PREV DISCUSSION... /issued 450 PM PDT Tue Oct 25 2022/ 

.SHORT TERM...Tonight through Thursday night...Radar and 
satellite imagery are showing increasing clouds, with a 
precipitation shield moving to the east-southeast west of the 
Cascades. This is in association with another upper trough that 
will dig southeast into the PacNW. This upper trough's axis will 
be over central OR by 09Z (2 AM PDT) tonight. Snow levels will 
drop to around 3500-4000 feet MSL by late tonight, resulting in 
the precipitation being mainly snow above these levels. QPF and 
snow amounts are now showing that enough snow will fall above 4000
feet MSL to reach Winter Weather Advisory criteria. As such a 
Winter Weather Advisory will be issued for the OR and WA Cascades 
above 4000 feet MSL from 5 PM PDT late this afternoon until 5 PM 
PDT late Wednesday afternoon. An advisory will also be issued for 
the Northern Blue Mountains of OR and WA for this same time frame 
above 4000 feet MSL. The heaviest accumulations will be along the 
Cascade crest, with lesser amounts below to 4000 feet MSL, and 
then mainly rain below 4000 feet MSL. In the Northern Blue 
Mountains, the snow will fall down to pass levels. The HREF QPF 
totals for 24 hours are in agreement with this scenario. Also, the
ECMWF and GEFS ensembles are in very good agreement with each 
other and the deterministic models with the timing and amplitude 
of this next upper trough. Elsewhere, snow levels will lower to 
4000 feet in the Ochoco Mountains, the John Day Highlands, 
Strawberry Mountains and the Elkhorn Mountains. However, snowfall 
in these areas are not expected to reach advisory amounts, and 
will be light. Rain will fall elsewhere, but rainfall amounts are 
expected to be light and mostly a tenth of an inch or less. 

This upper trough will exit the region with a northerly flow
behind it Wednesday night, followed by a transitory upper ridge on
Thursday, with dry conditions. The exception will be over the
central WA Cascades in northwest Kittitas and Yakima Counties
where more precipitation will develop in a southwest flow aloft 
west of the upper ridge axis on Thursday and Thursday night. This 
southwest flow will persist going into the extended forecast 
period. 

Temperatures will be a few degrees cooler on Wednesday than today.
Maximum readings will be in the mid to upper 50s in the lower
elevations and in the 30s and 40s in the mountains. After that,
warmer air is expected in the southwest flow that is expected to 
develop over the CWA on the back side of the upper ridge,
resulting in warmer temperatures. Highs on Thursday will rise to 
the upper 50s to mid 60s in the lower elevations and mostly 40s 
and 50s in the mountains, which will be slightly above normal. 
These warmer temperatures will continue into the extended forecast
period. 

Winds will be locally breezy to windy in the Lower Columbia Basin
and adjacent lower elevation areas, and also on the ridge tops in
the mountains. These winds are expected to persist through 
Wednesday evening and then they will diminish and become light 
later Wednesday night. Winds will then increase again in the 
Lower Columbia Basin by Thursday afternoon and evening. 88

.LONG TERM......Friday through Tuesday...The extended period is 
characterized by a marginally progressive pattern that incurs a 
couple systems that pass through the Pacific Northwest, keeping 
rain chances, breezy winds, and near normal temperatures in the 
forecast into next week. The main sensible weather concern is 
associated with gusty winds, as the ECMWF EFI highlights 
unclimatologically high values along the east slopes of the 
Washington Cascades and through the Lower Columbia Basin Sunday 
and Monday. Wind gusts look to peak overnight Sunday into early 
Monday morning with values between 30-35 mph before subsiding to 
20-27 mph through Monday afternoon. 

An upper level low pressure system, located in the Gulf of Alaska, 
and its attendant front, extending south through the northern 
Pacific, will dig and shift east on Friday. This will provide breezy 
winds and rain chances throughout the area. A cut-off low looks to 
develop off the coast of California in the wake of the passing 
system. This will cause more zonal flow to occur through the Pacific 
Northwest, keeping flow aloft mainly westerly and temperatures near 
normal for this time of year. Another upper level low pressure 
system quickly replaces Friday's system over the Gulf of Alaska, 
which digs slightly more south into British Columbia on Monday. 
Breezy winds and rain chances again increase as isobars tighten in 
response to the gradient between the dropping trough and transient 
ridging over the Four Corners region. The trough continues to drop 
along the coast Monday and begins to propagate onshore and east 
Tuesday. This will provide another chance for showers, breezy winds, 
and cooler temperatures as flow aloft becomes more northwesterly on 
Monday. The late period system looks much more robust than the 
earlier system, with snow levels dropping to the 3000-4000 foot 
range to allow for mountain snowfall to occur over the Cascades, 
Blues, and Wallowas beginning early Monday.

Guidance is in good agreement with the overall progressive pattern 
through the extended period, however, large discrepancies arise 
regarding ridge/trough strength, timing, and track. The ECMWF incurs 
a stronger initial shortwave on Friday, and a weaker, faster 
dropping trough Monday into Tuesday than the GFS. This would allow 
for earlier showers and winds Monday morning, and slightly warmer 
temperatures on Monday and Tuesday with the ECMWF scenario. The 500 
mb EOF patterns highlight this variability within ensembles, showing 
trough strength as being the main differences Saturday and Sunday 
with timing being the primary issue Monday and Tuesday. The cluster 
phase space shows the GFS deterministic and ensemble means being 
slightly better represented, but the ECMWF has a much tighter 
overall ensemble spread. Thus, a slight lean toward the ECMWF 
outcome was conducted through the extended period, which is 
represented well by the NBM. 75
