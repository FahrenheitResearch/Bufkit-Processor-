.SHORT TERM...Tonight through Friday Night...The upper trough that
brought snow to the mountains has moved into eastern Idaho and a
drier northwest flow has developed over the area. A few rain and 
snow showers linger over the Blue Mountains and Wallowa county but
they should be ending in the next couple of hours. Have cancelled
the Winter Weather Advisory for the northern Blue Mountains a few
hours early. The trough will develop into a cutoff low and sink 
southward tonight and tomorrow arriving into New Mexico by 
tomorrow afternoon. The northwest flow over the area will turn 
westerly by tomorrow morning as another trough develops in the 
Gulf of Alaska. This will give us dry weather tonight and tomorrow
with just a few light rain and snow showers over the Washington 
Cascades. Snow levels will rise from 3500 feet this afternoon to 
5500 feet by tomorrow afternoon so mainly rain will be seen at 
pass levels. Temperatures tonight will be a few degrees cooler 
than last night due to less cloud cover. Lows will be in the 30s 
and lower 40s with upper teens and 20s in the mountains. Breezy 
winds this afternoon will decrease this evening. Temperatures 
tomorrow will be several degrees warmer with highs in the mid 50s 
to lower 60s and in the 40s and lower 50s in the mountains.

Thursday night and Friday the trough will move to the British 
Columbia coast and the flow will turn southwesterly with a 
precipitation band setting up along the Cascades bringing a 
chance of rain and snow to the Washington Cascades reaching as far
as the Columbia Gorge and Yakima and Kittitas Valleys on Friday. 
Snow levels will rise to 6500 feet by Friday so rain is 
anticipated with amounts of one to two tenths of an inch expected.
Temperatures Thursday night will be in the upper 30s to mid 40s 
with mid 20s to mid 30s in the mountains. Temperatures will be a 
couple of degrees warmer than Thursday. Friday will see the trough
axis move to the Cascades and a slight chance of precipitation 
will spread across the Columbia Basin though not into the eastern 
mountains. Rain amounts will be light. Temperatures Friday night 
will be similar to Thursday night. Perry/83

.LONG TERM...Saturday through Wednesday...Predominantly active 
weather is likely to continue through the extended period, with 
zonal flow and a weak frontal boundary expected to stall over the 
forecast region for Saturday, and broad troughing with lowering snow 
levels favored as the most likely solution Monday onward. While 
confidence is high in a troughing pattern for the Pacific Northwest 
(90%), pattern details remain unclear beyond Sunday as ensemble 
cluster analysis reveals the usual suspects (timing and amplitude 
discrepancies among ensemble members) driving forecast uncertainty. 

The resulting forecast paints light PoPs across the forecast area 
Saturday and Sunday, primarily focused on the Cascades due to the 
zonal flow aloft. Snow levels of 5-7 kft are anticipated which is 
well above mountain pass levels with just light rain and snow for 
the Cascades in the forecast. Deterministic guidance suggests some 
weak synoptic lift and shortwave activity Saturday morning along a 
SW-NE oriented line from central Oregon through northeast Oregon. 
This may be enough for some light precipitation across central and 
eastern Oregon, though this would be <0.10" with the best chances 
for the mountains where orographic lift would aid any synoptic lift. 
Zonal flow will keep upslope precipitation chances for the Cascades 
Sunday, though snow levels of 6-8 kft will again keep snow above 
pass levels.

Looking beyond the weekend, the NBM blankets more widespread PoPs 
over the forecast area Monday through Wednesday due to the favored 
troughing pattern aloft. Potential impacts during this period 
include widespread breezy to locally windy conditions Monday 
followed by NBM-advertised snow levels lowering enough to dust areas 
above 2000 ft with some light snow.

Delving deeper into 12Z ensemble clusters reveals two likely 
solutions for Tuesday and Wednesday: the first, favored by roughly 
half of all ensemble members, is a deep trough over the Pacific 
Northwest. This would keep the forecast area wetter and cooler than 
the ensemble mean solution. In contrast, the other half of ensemble 
members suggest weaker, less amplified troughing for the Pacific 
Northwest. This solution would keep the forecast area warmer and 
drier. Looking at EOF patterns, timing differences account for 
roughly half of the variance Monday through Wednesday, while 
amplitude differences account for a further 25-30%. Plunkett/86

.AVIATION...18Z TAFS...VFR conditions expected through the period.
Clearing skies this morning will give way to SCT-BKN skies later
this afternoon and evening. Otherwise, 10-20 kt sustained winds 
at DLS/PDT/RDM/BDN are forecast today with gusts of 20-30 kts. 
Winds are anticipated to diminish to 10 kts or less overnight.
