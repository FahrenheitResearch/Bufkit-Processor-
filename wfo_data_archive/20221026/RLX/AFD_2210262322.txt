AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Charleston WV
722 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Cooler/drier tonight as a cold front exited east. High pressure
and drier weather builds in by Thursday. Southern stream 
disturbance brings back precipitation by the end of the weekend.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH THURSDAY/...
As of 137 PM Wednesday...

Low pressure system ejects northeast of the Great Lakes this 
evening, pushing a cold front far east. Wrap-around moisture 
from the Great Lakes will advect into our area under north to 
northwest flow, keeping abundant low level clouds tonight. These
clouds could spit light precipitation across the extreme 
northern WV and its northeast mountains tonight before 
dissipating during the overnight hours. H850 CAA is expected 
tonight under northerly flow providing cool conditions through 
Thursday and beyond. 

H850 northwest flow around 25 knots will subside to 10 knots
tonight. At the surface, northwest winds diminish some as they 
veer from the north overnight, and then light from the northeast
on Thursday. 

Low temperatures overnight should be in th mid 40s lowlands, ranging 
into the mid 30s northeast mountains and portions of southeast OH. 
Highs for Thursday will generally reach the 61 degree mark across 
the lowlands, ranging into the lower 50s highest elevations of 
our northeast mountains.

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
As of 245 PM Wednesday...

Subsidence yielded by surface high pressure maintains residence
over the area through the bulk of the forecast period. While an
upper level trough aims for Texas, southwesterly flow will
become more influential over the Tennessee Valley and into the
Central Appalachians. This will advertise a gradual warming 
trend to near normal readings for this time of year, accompanied
by periods of cloud coverage from advancing shortwaves out 
ahead of the disturbance down in the Central Plains. Afternoon 
highs rebound into the mid 60s by Friday for the lower 
elevations.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
As of 245 PM Wednesday...

Prevailing dry spell will come to an end for the latter half of
the weekend as a low pressure system encroaches from the south.
Model uncertainty still exists for onset precipitation and
overall coverage of this system, but opted to maintain strong
influence from central guidance with showers spreading overhead
from the southwest on Sunday. The H5 trough hosting this
disturbance is progged to weaken and become more of an open wave
by Sunday night, traversing the Ohio Valley and up into the
Great Lakes. Best window of opportunity for showers looks to be
between Sunday evening and Monday morning, especially along the
higher terrain. Another lobe of H5 energy swings through the
area Monday into Tuesday and will finally bring showers to a
gradual end.

Current thinking for Halloween evening will be 
closely monitoring the departure of these showers as the surface
low and parent trough propagate into New England. Temperatures
will be fairly mild Monday evening in the upper 50s/low 60s as
there are no signs of colder air filtering in right away with
this disturbance. Temperatures remain around or just below
normal through the course of the forecast period.

&&

.AVIATION /00Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/... 
As of 720 PM Wednesday...

Generally MVFR clouds will prevail this evening with some IFR in
the higher elevations of the mountains. The clouds will begin to
lift and clear from the west late tonight into Thursday,
becoming VFR at all locations by Thursday afternoon.
