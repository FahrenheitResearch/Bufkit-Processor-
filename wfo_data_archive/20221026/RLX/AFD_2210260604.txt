AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Charleston WV
204 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Well below normal temperatures with cold air and clouds rolling
in by this afternoon. Cold front and parent low exits by this 
evening. High pressure and dryer weather builds in by Thursday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
As of 155 AM Wednesday...

Current low pressure system providing rain this morning will
quickly exit to the northeast. This weather make will 
subsequently drag a cold front through the area from west to 
east and exit by early afternoon. Winds will change from a 
southerly flow to a more northwesterly flow and advect in 
cooler air and gusty winds area-wide by this afternoon. A very 
small diurnal trend is expected today with daytime highs not 
climbing much further then this mornings lows. This will cap 
temperatures out at around the upper 50's, maybe some areas 
hitting the 60 degree mark by the late afternoon. Most rain 
activity will subside by the late morning or early afternoon 
across the lowlands. Some lingering shower chances will remain 
in the northeast mountains into the early evening, but will be 
cut off as the system pulls further away from the region. Lows 
temperatures overnight are a little tricky due to expected cloud
coverage to linger around from post frontal stratus and wrap 
around flow from the aforementioned system. This coverage will 
persist through the rest of this period and possibly beyond 
with clouds suppressing any radiational cooling, causing 
another low diurnal trend for the overnight. Temperatures are 
expected to be anywhere from the mid 30's to mid 40's with the 
cooler temperatures anticipated across southeast Ohio and the 
northeast mountains. 

&&

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
As of 225 PM Tuesday...

Showers continue to lift out of the area Wednesday night as the
parent low pressure propagates northward and high pressure
builds overhead in its wake. Dry weather will then prevail
through the forecast period with an increasing influence of
southwest flow in response to a strengthening disturbance in the
ArkLaTex region. This wind regime will usher in warmer
temperatures from the Gulf, allowing for afternoon highs to
recover to near seasonable levels by Friday.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
As of 225 PM Tuesday...

Dry weather will rule the roost at the start of the forecast
period amid nearby high pressure. Low pressure generating over
Texas late in the work week will meander into the Ohio Valley by
the balance of the weekend. Model trends continue to depict a
delay in showers for the forecast area until late in the day
Sunday, so opted to push back onset precipitation from central
guidance until the conclusion of the weekend and into the start
of the new work week. Showers linger over the mountains on 
Tuesday as the tail end of the disturbance stretches southward 
and maintains influence over the Central Appalachians. 

Temperatures rounding out October will hold steady around 
normal for this time of year through the course of the period.

.AVIATION /06Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
As of 130 AM Wednesday...

Outside a possible drop to MVFR VIS due to a light to moderate 
shower, VFR will dominate until the late morning when the front
moves through a good part of the area and leaves behind lower
CIGs. Winds will remain elevated across the higher terrain 
sites where a LLJ has setup. Winds will start to increase in 
intensity across the lowlands by early afternoon. At that point 
in time gusty conditions will continue area-wide into the 
evening where gusts in the low to mid 20's will be likely, 
especially over EKN/BKW. Rain ends for most sites around the 
late morning except for EKN/CKB who get to endure showers into 
the afternoon. Some lingering showers or chances at least may 
stay over the northeast mountains, however they should not 
affect those sites up there with any restrictions. MVFR clouds 
roll in for the early afternoon area-wide and will persist 
through the rest of the period. Some CIGs could get into IFR 
territory at or near the eastern sites associated with post 
frontal stratus and wrap around flow for this evening.
