AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Charleston WV
1035 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Well below normal temperatures with cold air and clouds rolling
in by this afternoon. Cold front and parent low exits by this 
evening. High pressure and drier weather builds in by Thursday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
As of 1034 AM Wednesday...

Previous forecast remains on track. No changes needed at this
time.

As of 155 AM Wednesday...

Current low pressure system providing rain this morning will
quickly exit to the northeast. This weather maker will 
subsequently drag a cold front through the area from west to 
east and exit by early afternoon. Winds will change from a 
southerly flow to a more northwesterly flow and advect in 
cooler air and gusty winds area-wide by this afternoon. A very 
small diurnal trend is expected today with daytime highs not 
climbing much further then this mornings lows. This will cap 
temperatures out at around the upper 50s, maybe some areas 
hitting the 60 degree mark by the late afternoon. Most rain 
activity will subside by the late morning or early afternoon 
across the lowlands. Some lingering shower chances will remain 
in the northeast mountains into the early evening, but will be 
cut off as the system pulls further away from the region. Low 
temperatures overnight are a little tricky due to expected cloud
coverage to linger around from post frontal stratus and wrap 
around flow from the aforementioned system. This coverage will 
persist through the rest of this period and possibly beyond with
clouds suppressing any radiational cooling, causing another low
diurnal trend for the overnight. Temperatures are expected to 
be anywhere from the mid 30s to mid 40s with the cooler 
temperatures anticipated across southeast Ohio and the northeast
mountains.

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
As of 330 AM Wednesday...

High pressure at the end of the week keeps conditions dry through 
Saturday with mostly sunny skies. Patchy morning valley fog will be 
possible; however it will be extremely limited as water 
temperatures are cooler during this time of year. Decided to not
include in the current forecast package. High temperatures 
should trend a degree or two warmer Thursday through Saturday. 
Overnight lows will be near or below normals as clear skies 
allow radiational cooling to occur.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
As of 330 AM Wednesday...

Saturday night into Monday the weather pattern slowly transitions as 
the next trough moves up from the southwest. High uncertainty 
remains in the forecast for the beginning of the next week as models 
are struggling on how quickly to break the ridge down across 
the northeastern states. This forecast package was updated to 
delay the onset of rain chances, as model trends continue to 
slow the the progression of the trough. As for temperatures, 
near or above normals can be expected as southerly flow 
influences the extended period.

.AVIATION /15Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
As of 625 AM Wednesday...

Cold frontal passage is taking place and will leave minor
restrictions to VIS under any light to moderate showers. This
feature will also drag in MVFR CIGs on the backside of the 
front. MVFR clouds roll in for early afternoon generally area-
wide and will persist through the rest of the period. Winds 
will remain elevated across the higher elevated sites where a 
low level jet has setup. Winds will start to increase in 
intensity across the lowlands by early afternoon. At that point 
in time, gusty conditions will continue area-wide into the 
evening where gusts around 20KT+ will be likely, especially 
over EKN/BKW. The rain ends for most sites around the late 
morning except for EKN/CKB who get to endure showers into the 
afternoon. Some lingering showers or at least chances may stay 
over the northeast mountains, however they should not affect 
those sites up there with any extra restrictions. Some CIGs 
could get into IFR territory at or near the eastern sites 
associated with post frontal stratus and wrap around flow for 
this evening.
