AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Charleston WV
151 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Cooler/drier tonight as a cold front exited east. High pressure
and drier weather builds in by Thursday. Southern stream 
disturbance brings back precipitation by the end of the weekend.


&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH THURSDAY/...
As of 137 PM Wednesday...

Low pressure system ejects northeast of the Great Lakes this 
evening, pushing a cold front far east. Wrap-around moisture 
from the Great Lakes will advect into our area under north to 
northwest flow, keeping abundant low level clouds tonight. These
clouds could spit light precipitation across the extreme 
northern WV and its northeast mountains tonight before 
dissipating during the overnight hours. H850 CAA is expected 
tonight under northerly flow providing cool conditions through 
Thursday and beyond. 

H850 northwest flow around 25 knots will subside to 10 knots
tonight. At the surface, northwest winds diminish some as they 
veer from the north overnight, and then light from the northeast
on Thursday. 

Low temperatures overnight should be in th mid 40s lowlands, ranging 
into the mid 30s northeast mountains and portions of southeast OH. 
Highs for Thursday will generally reach the 61 degree mark across 
the lowlands, ranging into the lower 50s highest elevations of 
our northeast mountains.

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
As of 330 AM Wednesday...

High pressure at the end of the week keeps conditions dry through 
Saturday with mostly sunny skies. Patchy morning valley fog will be 
possible; however it will be extremely limited as water 
temperatures are cooler during this time of year. Decided to not
include in the current forecast package. High temperatures 
should trend a degree or two warmer Thursday through Saturday. 
Overnight lows will be near or below normals as clear skies 
allow radiational cooling to occur.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
As of 330 AM Wednesday...

Saturday night into Monday the weather pattern slowly transitions as 
the next trough moves up from the southwest. High uncertainty 
remains in the forecast for the beginning of the next week as models 
are struggling on how quickly to break the ridge down across 
the northeastern states. This forecast package was updated to 
delay the onset of rain chances, as model trends continue to 
slow the the progression of the trough. As for temperatures, 
near or above normals can be expected as southerly flow 
influences the extended period.

.AVIATION /18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
As of 131 PM Wednesday...

A cold front has exited east of the Appalachians this afternoon 
taking most of the rain showers with it. However, abundant low level 
moisture will keep MVFR ceilings spreading east, and perhaps few 
sprinkles over the northern sections through tonight. Satellite and 
model data suggest wrap around moisture from the parent low pressure 
system, could bring upslope precipitation across the northeast 
mountains through at least 03Z. Localized IFR conditions possible 
along the central and northern mountains to affect EKN and BKW 
overnight due to mountain obscuration. Otherwise, MVFR ceilings
will prevail at most sites tonight, with localized IFR
conditions possible especially over the mountains. Expect
improving conditions to widespread VFR by 13Z Thursday. 

Northwest winds at H850 will subside to 20 knots tonight, while at 
the surface, winds will be light mainly from the north. Winds pick 
up some from the northeast on Thursday afternoon.
