AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Charleston WV
907 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Above normal temperatures tonight. Low pressure system arrives
tonight, bringing some rain potential through Wednesday. Cooler
temperatures behind the front with a gradual recovery.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
As of 850 PM Tuesday...

No major changes made this update. Did adjust POPs to account
for current progression and latest high-res guidance, which sped
things up a bit, but only by about an hour in spots. Heaviest
rain totals remain in SE Ohio and perhaps into the Ohio Valley 
near our northern border, but even there it should be under a 
half inch, with less than a quarter inch across most the WV, KY,
and VA portions of the CWA.

As of 157 PM Tuesday...

Surface high pressure slides off the Mid Atlantic coast this 
evening, allowing a stacked low pressure system and its associated 
cold front to approach from the west, and bring mainly rain 
showers to the area overnight tonight and Wednesday. Although 
the NBM is faster with drier conditions behind the front, model 
consensus have light rain showers lingering across the northern 
and eastern portions of WV through Wednesday evening. Therefore,
extended PoPs to account for this. With very weak dynamic and 
thermodynamic instability, kept thunderstorm out of the forecast
for now. 

H850 wind increasing from 20 to 40 knots overnight under warm 
advection will likely allow for some wind gusts across the higher 
elevations and near any convection tonight. 

The actual cold front crosses east Wednesday morning with light rain 
lingering behind in mainly across the eastern mountains. Above
normal temperatures can be expected tonight, generally in the 
mid 50s lowlands, into the mid 40s highest elevations of our 
northeast mountains. Highs on Wednesday will range from the
lower 60s lowlands, into the low 50s highest elevations.

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
As of 225 PM Tuesday...

Showers continue to lift out of the area Wednesday night as the
parent low pressure propagates northward and high pressure
builds overhead in its wake. Dry weather will then prevail
through the forecast period with an increasing influence of
southwest flow in response to a strengthening disturbance in the
ArkLaTex region. This wind regime will usher in warmer
temperatures from the Gulf, allowing for afternoon highs to
recover to near seasonable levels by Friday.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
As of 225 PM Tuesday...

Dry weather will rule the roost at the start of the forecast
period amid nearby high pressure. Low pressure generating over
Texas late in the work week will meander into the Ohio Valley by
the balance of the weekend. Model trends continue to depict a
delay in showers for the forecast area until late in the day
Sunday, so opted to push back onset precipitation from central
guidance until the conclusion of the weekend and into the start
of the new work week. Showers linger over the mountains on 
Tuesday as the tail end of the disturbance stretches southward 
and maintains influence over the Central Appalachians. 

Temperatures rounding out October will hold steady around 
normal for this time of year through the course of the period.

.AVIATION /01Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
As of 745 PM Tuesday...

VFR conditions will persist through midnight, before rain 
starts pushing across the area from west to east. The main area 
of rain to our west currently presents as a fairly cohesive 
band, with a sprinkling of showers ahead of and behind it, and 
the current forecast has this general concept continuing across 
our CWA. There could be periods of MVFR or even IFR visibility 
in any locally heavier rain, but kept prevailing visibility at 
6SM in periods of rain. Ceilings will lower as rain moves 
through, but it looks ceilings don't drop to MVFR until the 
front (which trails the convection) pushes into the area - 
generally between 09z and 16z from west to east.

Winds should remain mostly light this evening and early
overnight, except at BKW and elsewhere in the higher terrain 
where gusts along the ridgetops are possible. Did put in some 
areas of LLWS overnight, as it looks like a LLJ around 850-900mb
will develop ahead of the front.
