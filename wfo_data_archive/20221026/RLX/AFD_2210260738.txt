AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Charleston WV
338 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Well below normal temperatures with cold air and clouds rolling
in by this afternoon. Cold front and parent low exits by this 
evening. High pressure and drier weather builds in by Thursday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
As of 155 AM Wednesday...

Current low pressure system providing rain this morning will
quickly exit to the northeast. This weather make will 
subsequently drag a cold front through the area from west to 
east and exit by early afternoon. Winds will change from a 
southerly flow to a more northwesterly flow and advect in 
cooler air and gusty winds area-wide by this afternoon. A very 
small diurnal trend is expected today with daytime highs not 
climbing much further then this mornings lows. This will cap 
temperatures out at around the upper 50's, maybe some areas 
hitting the 60 degree mark by the late afternoon. Most rain 
activity will subside by the late morning or early afternoon 
across the lowlands. Some lingering shower chances will remain 
in the northeast mountains into the early evening, but will be 
cut off as the system pulls further away from the region. Low 
temperatures overnight are a little tricky due to expected cloud
coverage to linger around from post frontal stratus and wrap 
around flow from the aforementioned system. This coverage will 
persist through the rest of this period and possibly beyond with
clouds suppressing any radiational cooling, causing another low
diurnal trend for the overnight. Temperatures are expected to 
be anywhere from the mid 30s to mid 40s with the cooler 
temperatures anticipated across southeast Ohio and the northeast
mountains.

&&

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
As of 330 AM Wednesday...

High pressure at the end of the week keeps conditions dry through 
Saturday with mostly sunny skies. Patchy morning valley fog will be 
possible; however it will be extremely limited as water 
temperatures are cooler during this time of year. Decided to not
include in the current forecast package. High temperatures 
should trend a degree or two warmer Thursday through Saturday. 
Overnight lows will be near or below normals as clear skies 
allow radiational cooling to occur. 

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
As of 330 AM Wednesday...

Saturday night into Monday the weather pattern slowly transitions as 
the next trough moves up from the southwest. High uncertainty 
remains in the forecast for the beginning of the next week as models 
are struggling on how quickly to break the ridge down across 
the northeastern states. This forecast package was updated to 
delay the onset of rain chances, as model trends continue to 
slow the the progression of the trough. As for temperatures, 
near or above normals can be expected as southerly flow 
influences the extended period.

.AVIATION /07Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
As of 130 AM Wednesday...

Outside a possible drop to MVFR VIS due to a light to moderate 
shower, VFR will dominate until the late morning when the front
moves through a good part of the area and leaves behind lower
CIGs. Winds will remain elevated across the higher terrain 
sites where a LLJ has setup. Winds will start to increase in 
intensity across the lowlands by early afternoon. At that point 
in time gusty conditions will continue area-wide into the 
evening where gusts in the low to mid 20's will be likely, 
especially over EKN/BKW. Rain ends for most sites around the 
late morning except for EKN/CKB who get to endure showers into 
the afternoon. Some lingering showers or chances at least may 
stay over the northeast mountains, however they should not 
affect those sites up there with any restrictions. MVFR clouds 
roll in for the early afternoon area-wide and will persist 
through the rest of the period. Some CIGs could get into IFR 
territory at or near the eastern sites associated with post 
frontal stratus and wrap around flow for this evening.
