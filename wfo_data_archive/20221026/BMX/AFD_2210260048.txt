.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Wednesday)
Issued at 720 PM CDT TUE OCT 25 2022

A cold front was located just southeast of the I-59 corridor this
evening. The front will continue eastward and clear the area after
midnight. Showers and a few thunderstorms were ongoing ahead of
the front from near Anniston to Montgomery. Shear remains high
over the area but instabilities were limited and lapse rates were
poor. Do not expect any uptick in this activity as it exits the
area after midnight. Gusty Winds will slowly subside through the
evening. The chances of any gusts near 35 mph is rather low and
will cancel whats left of the Wind Advisory.

A potent upper low was located over the Ozarks in Northern
Arkansas within a negative tilted trough over the Mid South
Region. Surface low pressure has become more organized over
Southeast Missouri with a cold front extending from Southwest of
St. Louis south through Central Mississippi. Regional radar
composites with satellite animations indicate the convection has
been strengthening gradually with time over the past few hours as
the activity is moving east through an area with temperatures in
the lower 70s with dew points in the upper 60s. Surface-based
instability persists in a fairly narrow swath along and just
ahead of the convective line from eastern Mississippi to near the
AL/MS state line per 17z RAP mesoanalysis data. The highest shear
and best forcing is positioned across Northeast Mississippi and 
Northwest Alabama at this writing. Through mid afternoon, expect 
the line of storms to continue moving east into West-Central and 
Northwest Alabama from 1 to 3 pm.

A tornado watch is currently being issued for the western portion
of the area, generally near Interstate 65 and west through 7 pm
tonight.

Tonight.

Showers with some thunderstorms will continue to move east,
affecting much of the eastern portion of the area tonight. The
overall intensity of the line is expected to gradually weaken with
time with damaging winds being the primary concern with bows
within the line of storms. There will remain a tornado risk with
embedded circulations, QLCS, within the line of storms. Winds will
gradually weaken overnight from the southwest to west at 6-12 mph.
Lows will range from the mid 40s northwest to the low 50s
southeast.

Wednesday.

Dry conditions will return areawide on Wednesday but cloud cover
will likely linger through the morning hours then clearing
entirely from southwest to northeast through the daytime hours.
Winds will be from the west to northwest at 6-12 mph. Highs will
range from the mid 60s north to around 70 far southeast.

Models have trended slightly wetter for the system next weekend,
and trended rain changes and qpf upward. Otherwise, no changes
needed.

Flow aloft becomes southwesterly through the rest of the week
ahead of the next trough digging into the Southern High Plains in
this progressive split flow pattern. At the surface, winds will 
be out of the east courtesy of a strong high pressure center 
centered over Quebec, though the associated CAD wedge should stay 
northeast of the area. The easterly winds will keep dew points and
RH values from crashing as much as in recent days as well as low 
temperatures to a certain extent. Expect pleasant conditions with 
a good bit of sunshine. 

The southern stream trough will eventually close off into a slow-
moving upper low that will impact the forecast area over the
weekend. Deep layer SSW flow ahead of the upper low will
eventually result in moist isentropic lift and widespread rainfall
at some point during the weekend, while a weak surface low lifts 
northward over the Lower Mississippi Valley. The deterministic GFS
trended slower towards the deterministic ECMWF with the area
remaining mostly dry Saturday afternoon. However, am leery of
buying this trend as these are just 2 of 80 ensemble members, and
the ensemble means and many ensemble members of the EPS and GEFS
are quicker than the deterministic runs. Therefore, leaned heavily
on the ensemble members for timing of the higher PoPs but have
capped values at 50% for now. A warm front may lift northward into
our southern counties with enough instability for a few
thunderstorms. 0-6 km bulk shear values are only around 30-35 kts,
so severe storms are not expected at this time.

A cold front was moving through Central Alabama as of this
writing. It was approaching BHM/EET as winds have turned to the 
west at TCL. Showers and a few thunderstorms were ahead of the 
front from near ANB to MGM. The convection will affect 
ANB/ASN/MGM/TOI for another hour or so before exiting the area. 
There may be a brief period of MVFR ceilings near this convection.
A wrap around moisture area will follow behind the front and also
may produce some MVFR ceilings for the northern sites. Gusty 
southerly winds will veer to west and then north as high pressure 
moves in behind the front.

Drier conditions return for Wednesday and Thursday, but with 
minimum RH values above critical thresholds. Low level winds swing
around to the north Wednesday and northeast Thursday.
