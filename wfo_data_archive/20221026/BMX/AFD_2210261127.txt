.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 244 AM CDT WED OCT 26 2022

The cold front has just cleared the very last bit of our far 
southeastern county. Behind it clear skies are the rule south of the 
I-20 corridor. Further north an upper low is beginning to slide into 
the area. Look for an increase in low level clouds through mid-
morning across the north, with generally sunny skies in the south. 
Highs will be in the middle 60s to low 70s. There could some 
scattered clouds again late tonight into Thursday morning across the 
north once again, but this would be due to a wedge of moisture 
moving in from the east as high pressure builds in to our our north 
and increases the easterly flow. On Thursday we will see generally 
sunny skies. Some cirrus may work in across the north late 
afternoon, but should have limited impacts to the temperatures. 
Highs will be in the upper 60s to middle 70s.

The next southern stream trough in this progressive split flow
pattern will reach the Southern High Plains Thursday night, with a
slow-moving closed upper low forming over Texas by Friday. High
clouds will begin to stream northeastwards across Central Alabama
starting on Friday. At the surface a 1035mb high will move into
New England with a CAD wedge building down the lee of the
Appalachians, resulting in breezy easterly winds across Central
Alabama. High temperatures Friday will be dependent on the
strength of the wedge as well as cloudcover. The center of the
upper low reaches the ArkLaTex by Saturday while a weak surface
low begins to develop over Louisiana and various waves in 
southwest flow aloft move towards Central Alabama. Strengthening
and moistening southwest flow aloft and a veering wind profile
will result in moist isentropic lift, starting off aloft 
initially and then lowering. 

There are still some model/ensemble differences regarding how 
quickly precipitation starts. These differences now appear to be 
less regarding the placement of the upper low, but possibly 
related to the impacts of a potential eastward moving MCS near the
Louisiana Gulf Coast and what impacts that has the on the 
moisture and wind fields inland. But in general expect rain 
chances to increase from the southwest Saturday morning into 
Saturday evening. Rainfall will be light initially, becoming more 
moderate in intensity Saturday night as PWATs increase to around 
1.5 inches. There is some model variability on rainfall amounts, 
potentially due to the impacts of coastal convection, resulting in
potential QPF solutions ranging from less than an a half inch to 
1-2 inches of beneficial rainfall. There will be some weak 
elevated MUCAPE Saturday night across some the western and 
southern counties resulting in a few rumbles of thunder. Breezy 
easterly winds continue due to the gradient between low pressure 
lifting northward over the ArkLaMiss and the wedge high to the 
east, but winds/wind gusts should remain below advisory criteria.

Rain continues into Sunday, decreasing from to southwest to
northeast as a mid-level dry slot moves in. A warm front will also
be lifting northeastward through the area Sunday morning, but
easterly flow should have a tendency to pinch off the warm sector
making the front more occluded. Some low to mid 60s dew points 
could lift northward into our southeast counties allowing some 
surface-based instability to develop. However, 0-6km bulk shear 
values are only around 30 kts, higher low-level shear remains on 
the cool side of the front, and upper support will be lifting 
north of the area. So severe storms are not expected at this time.
Despite the mid-level dry slot, wraparound low-level moisture 
lingers Sunday night which may result in some continued areas of 
light rain or drizzle. Weak troughing remains over the area Monday
and Tuesday. Some guidance indicates enough moisture for some 
light rain at times, but confidence is too low to mention PoPs 
except in the far northeast on Monday.

(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 625 AM CDT WED OCT 26 2022

Wrap around low clouds will remain possible in the north through the
morning, but should be just north of the TAF sites after 18z. 
Winds will be out of the northwest around 10 kts this afternoon.
Calming to less than 5 kts after 2 to 4z.

.FIRE WEATHER...

Drier conditions return for the rest of the week, but with 
minimum RH values above critical thresholds. RH values could drop
to near 40 percent in spots on Thursday. 20ft winds swing around 
from the northwest today to the northeast Thursday and the east 
on Friday, remaining less than 10 mph. Rain returns 
Saturday/Saturday night with an increase in winds.
