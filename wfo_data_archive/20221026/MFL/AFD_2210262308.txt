evening across South Florida. Enjoy!

.SHORT TERM...
(Rest of today through Thursday)
Issued at 244 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A cold frontal boundary associated with a shortwave around the 850mb 
level will begin to arrive in northern Florida today and erode the 
present high pressure on Thursday. However, the high pressure should 
stick around into late day on Thursday, keeping winds light until 
then. Nearly zonal flow at other levels combined with the winds 
being generally light will limit the potential of the front to 
influence south Florida as it should stall out in central Florida. 
Therefore, any potential for a couple of isolated showers/storms 
would likely be confined more to northern portions of Hendry county, 
Glades county, and Lake Okeechobee. Other than that, conditions will 
be primarily dry with light winds. Temperatures peak in the mid to 
upper 80s with overnight lows in the upper 60s. However, some 
locations near the Atlantic and Gulf shores may see low temperatures 
in the low 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through next Tuesday)
Issued at 244 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

To wrap up the week into next week, high pressure will form and 
bring a period of mostly dry conditions over South Florida. With a
large low in the southern US/Gulf Coast, and a low to our east, 
the ridging will keep most moisture out of the region to maintain 
dry conditions. The shift to a northeast-easterly wind, with what 
little moisture is available, will create a slight chance for 
occasional light showers along the Atlantic Coast over the 
weekend. The next cold front approaches southeastern US by late 
Sunday/early Monday. However, models are currently keeping the 
showers further into northern FL. In the extended outlook, 
temperatures will remain near normal with little change. 
Regionwide, seasonal highs will range from the mid-to-upper 80s. 
Overnight, the interior's lows will be in the mid-60s with 
slightly warmer temperatures, upper 60s-to-low 70s, elsewhere.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 705 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR through the 00Z TAF period. Light and variable winds through
Thursday morning becoming easterly 5-10 kts during the afternoon,
except APF where a SW breeze will develop. Isolated showers/storms
are possible around the lake during the afternoon into early
evening, but shouldn't impact the terminals. 

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 244 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Seas for the next couple of days will be lowering to around 1-2ft as 
swell subsides, keeping conditions fairly calm. Swell increases 
again this weekend with seas potentially climbing back into the 
cautionary category.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 244 PM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

There is limited to no threat for rip currents today and on Thursday 
as winds will be light. Winds begin to increase Friday into the 
weekend which will raise the risks for rips over the weekend.

The Atlantic beaches remain under a minor coastal flooding risk due 
to ongoing king tides.  In addition, Collier county beaches may 
experience minor coastal flooding during this evenings high tide 
cycle.
