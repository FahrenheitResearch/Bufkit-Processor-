...New UPDATE...

.UPDATE...
Issued at 918 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

There are no changes to today's forecast as another dry day is
expected under mostly clear clear to only party cloudy skies
across south Florida.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 235 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Weakening high pressure over the eastern US will lose its influence 
on South Florida today as an area of low pressure with its 
associated fronts moves through the eastern US. The upper-lvl 
system will be fairly low amplitude so the cold front associated 
with it will likely stall and weaken prior to reaching our area. 
Therefore, although synoptic winds will begin to shift more 
southwesterly ahead of the front, the overall wind fields should 
remain very weak, limiting the amount of prefrontal moisture 
return. Consequently, expect a generally dry day with any 
precipitation remaining north of the area along the (dying) front.
Conditions will generally remain unchanged on Thursday with the 
weakened front stalled just north of our area, but there could be 
some showers that develop over the Lake Okeechobee region. High 
temperatures will generally be in the mid to upper 80s on both 
days, with overnight lows in the upper 60s to low 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 235 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Friday and into the weekend, high pressure will build over the eastern 
US and extend down over Florida, in between a low pressure system
off the southeast US coast, and another in the Gulf. This setup 
will lead to generally dry conditions across the area, although 
the return to northeastâ€”easterly wind combined with what little 
moisture is available, may create a very slight chance for light 
showers along the east coast each day. Another cold front will be 
moving into the southeast US early next week, but the consensus at
this time is that it will remain north of our area. So, expect 
the dry conditions to be paired with temperatures around normal 
for the Friday through Wednesday timeframe. Highs will range from 
the mid-to-upper 80s with interior lows in the mid-60s and upper 
60s to low 70s elsewhere.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 723 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions continue for this TAF period. Variable winds are
expected most hours, but a light easterly sea breeze likely 
develops this afternoon for east coast terminals and a light
westerly gulf breeze at APF. Winds become light and variable again
in the evening. 

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 235 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Any residual N-NE swell should subside this morning with largely 
benign marine conditions then prevailing through the remainder of
the workweek as a weak front stalls north of the area. 

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 235 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

As N-NE swell subsides and onshore flow decreases today, the rip 
current risk should generally decrease over the east coast through
the remainder of the work week.

Elevated astronomical tides will continue to bring the potential for minor coastal 
flooding along the east coast during the times of the highest 
diurnal high tides (mid-late morning) through Thursday.
