.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Friday night)
Issued at 204 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

The upper level trough that brought rain and cooler weather has 
moved east of our area and will leave near normal highs behind it. 
Wednesday should be quiet with some clouds building in over central 
Kansas spreading eastward. 

Thursday looks to be our best chance for rain as an upper level low 
will dive into the eastern U.S Southwest. A subtle piece of energy 
will round the base of the upper low and will move northward into 
south-central and central Kansas. This should allow for scattered 
showers to develop Thursday afternoon through early Friday morning. 
Any meaningful rainfall would likely be isolated with that round of 
storms. 

Models continue to shift south with the upper low on Friday, as of 
now this would completely keep rain south of our area Friday morning 
and throughout the day. Overall, rainfall totals look much lighter 
with this system compared to the previous.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Tuesday)
Issued at 204 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

We should see a slow warming trend this weekend with flow at the 
surface becoming westerly to southwesterly. Saturday and Sunday 
still look to be near to below normal for highs. By Monday into 
Tuesday we should see heights rise as global probabilistic and 
deterministic models hint towards a trough developing off the West 
Coast. This would lead to above average highs returning to our 
region.
