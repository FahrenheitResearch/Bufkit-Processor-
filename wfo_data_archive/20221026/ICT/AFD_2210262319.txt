Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Wichita KS
619 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Saturday night)
Issued at 225 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Current satellite water vapor imagery shows a healthy upper level 
system over Idaho/western Montana moving southeast across the 
Rockies. The good quality low-level moisture has been swept well 
southward into the Gulf of Mexico from the previous weather system. 
Scattered high based rain showers are still possible across mainly 
central/south central Kansas on Thursday/Thursday night due to 
strong upper dynamics associated with this weather system. The rain 
chances will diminish for Kansas on Friday, as the projected path of 
this system by the models dives south of the area. 

We could see some light rain showers possibly return to parts of far 
southern/southeast Kansas for Friday night-Saturday night, 
especially if models shift the track a bit northward like some of 
the latest trends suggest. In addition, the clouds wrapping around 
the north side of this system could also hinder day-time heating 
across southern Kansas for Friday and Saturday. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Wednesday)
Issued at 225 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Models show decaying upper level system moving slowly eastward into 
Missouri on Sunday, with some possible residual light rain affecting 
far southeast Kansas during the day on Sunday. Otherwise a gradual 
warming trend along with dry weather conditions looks to prevail 
across the central plains for Monday-Wednesday next week. Above 
normal daytime highs are likely across central and southeast
Kansas.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Thursday evening)
Issued at 617 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions are expected through this TAF period. The only
issue will be some gusty winds during the day tomorrow and the
chances for thunderstorms as well. The KRSL, KGBD and KSLN
terminals will be the most likely to see showers or 
thunderstorms. At this time, the thunderstorm risk remains very 
low so kept the thunder out of the TAF for now. After this TAF 
period, could see some increasing chances for showers or 
thunderstorms for all terminals.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 225 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Very high grassland fire danger will affect parts of south 
central Kansas until sunset today. Meanwhile fire weather risk 
will be low from Thursday-Monday across the entire area, however 
increasing south winds combined with warmer temperatures look to 
elevate grassland fire risk into the very high category for 
Tuesday- Wednesday afternoons next week.
