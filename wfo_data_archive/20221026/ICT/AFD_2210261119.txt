.SHORT TERM...(Today through Friday night)
Issued at 254 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A weak ridge of high pressure will dominate the weather pattern for 
the next 24 hours, slowly shifting east into the Missouri Valley, by 
this afternoon and tonight. Expect temperatures near seasonal 
normals, with breezy conditions for central KS, as surface winds on 
the backside of the ridge slowly increase. 

A shortwave in the Pacific NW, will quickly move south-southeast 
across the Rockies into the southern plains by Thu night. Latest 
deterministic model data suggests this shortwave is trending towards 
the ECMWF solution, which keeps the the shortwave further to the 
west across the Rockies, as it plunges south into the southern 
plains. So with this trend in mind, with collaboration with 
neighboring offices, have decided to cut back on pops some for the 
daytime hours on Thu. Still plan on keeping a chance pop across 
central KS, as a weak impulse spins off the main shortwave, which 
will increase moisture transport enough for at least a light rain 
chance. Trending back on rainfall amounts as well, as bufkit 
soundings suggest lowest 5000 kt will stay relatively dry, limiting 
rainfall amounts to less than a tenth of an inch, with most places 
only seeing a few hundredths. 

Models are also trending the shortwave further south, is it moves 
into the southern plains, for Thu night, which will keep most of the 
moisture and rain chances for Thu night just south of the forecast 
area over OK and TX. So will trim back pops across southern KS as 
well for Thu night.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Tuesday)
Issued at 254 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Expect a slight warming trend going into the weekend, after the 
southern plains shortwave moves E-NE, with weak westerly or NW flow 
leading to downslope conditions and temperatures inching back above 
normal.

VFR conditions are expected through the TAF period. A few mid

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 254 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Breezy southeast winds gusting to 25 mph, and relative 
humidity values falling to around 25 percent, will create a very 
high grassland fire danger across south central Kansas for this 
afternoon. The concern will be located over Kingman and Reno 
counties.
