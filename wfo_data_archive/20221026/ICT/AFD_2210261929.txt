Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Wichita KS
229 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Saturday night)
Issued at 225 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Current satellite water vapor imagery shows a healthy upper level 
system over Idaho/western Montana moving southeast across the 
Rockies. The good quality low-level moisture has been swept well 
southward into the Gulf of Mexico from the previous weather system. 
Scattered high based rain showers are still possible across mainly 
central/south central Kansas on Thursday/Thursday night due to 
strong upper dynamics associated with this weather system. The rain 
chances will diminish for Kansas on Friday, as the projected path of 
this system by the models dives south of the area. 

We could see some light rain showers possibly return to parts of far 
southern/southeast Kansas for Friday night-Saturday night, 
especially if models shift the track a bit northward like some of 
the latest trends suggest. In addition, the clouds wrapping around 
the north side of this system could also hinder day-time heating 
across southern Kansas for Friday and Saturday. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Wednesday)
Issued at 225 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Models show decaying upper level system moving slowly eastward into 
Missouri on Sunday, with some possible residual light rain affecting 
far southeast Kansas during the day on Sunday. Otherwise a gradual 
warming trend along with dry weather conditions looks to prevail 
across the central plains for Monday-Wednesday next week. Above 
normal daytime highs are likely across central and southeast
Kansas.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Thursday afternoon)
Issued at 1200 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

VFR conditions expected to prevail thru the forecast valid period
with low level wind shear tonight across parts of central Kansas. 
Southeast surface flow will increase this afternoon into midday 
on Thursday to the east of a deepening lee side trof in response 
to an upper shortwave advancing toward the Rockies. The developing
nocturnal low level jet will result in LLWS for the higher 
terrain of central Kansas, including the KRSL/KGBD terminals 
tonight. Otherwise, a gradual increase in high level saturating to
a mid-level cloud deck is expected into Thursday morning.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 225 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Very high grassland fire danger will affect parts of south 
central Kansas until sunset today. Meanwhile fire weather risk 
will be low from Thursday-Monday across the entire area, however 
increasing south winds combined with warmer temperatures look to 
elevate grassland fire risk into the very high category for 
Tuesday- Wednesday afternoons next week.
