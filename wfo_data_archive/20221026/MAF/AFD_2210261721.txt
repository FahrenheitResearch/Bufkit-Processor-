.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Thursday afternoon)
Issued at 325 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

WV imagery shows zonal flow over West Texas and Southeast New  
Mexico, making for a rather prosaic morning across the region. An 
upper trough has made landfall in the PacNW, and is forecast to 
dig down to near the Four Corners by 18Z Thursday. Surface obs 
show light and variable winds at the moment, but return flow 
resumes today in the east, and southwest-to-west flow over the 
higher terrain, in response to leeside troughing on the Front 
Range as the PacNW trough digs SE. This will allow afternoon highs
to warm 5-7F over yesterday's...near normal most locations. 
Tonight, a 30+kt LLJ is set to develop, advecting Gulf moisture 
into the area. This will keep mixing in play, and with higher 
dewpoints and increasing high cloud, overnight lows will warm a 
similar 5-7F over this morning's. Thursday, as mentioned above, 
the trough will dig into New Mexico, and is forecast to center 
over east central New Mexico by 00Z Friday. 700mb height gradients
will approach 60m/200nm during the late afternoon, signaling a 
few hours of high winds in the Guadalupes. Downslope warming will 
add 1-3F to afternoon highs everywhere but Southeast New Mexico, 
where the cold front accompanying the trough may spoil highs 
before the afternoon is over.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through Tuesday)
Issued at 325 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Thursday night, the trough responsible for the windy conditions  
across the Guadalupe Mountains will develop a positive tilt as it 
progresses southeastward from New Mexico across West Texas through 
Friday morning. Ahead of the trough, a dryline will be in place 
across the region, with dewpoints likely to be in the upper 
40s/50s across the eastern Permian Basin and Lower Trans Pecos. As
ascent increases and temperatures aloft cool in response to the 
trough's progression, convective potential will increase, 
especially across northern and eastern portions of the forecast 
area. The greatest likelihood of thunderstorms will be focused 
across eastern zones in closer proximity to the dryline, where 
interaction with the trough's associated Pacific front is progged 
to result in some strong, possibly severe thunderstorms. Storms 
will remain elevated, with the cold temperatures aloft yielding a 
threat of large hail, with damaging downburst winds also a concern
with the stronger storms. Storms that develop Thursday night will
quickly move east, though rain chances will linger through the 
night and into Friday morning as a cold front moves through the 
region with additional potential for wrap-around precipitation 
associated with the trough as it translates southeastward across 
Central Texas. 

In the wake of the departing system, temperatures have continued
to trend downward for Friday, given expected lingering cloud 
cover and continued cold advection accompanied by breezy northerly
to northwesterly winds. Highs are currently forecast to range 
from the middle 50s to middle 60s for most, with 70s across the 
Rio Grande Valley, roughly 10-15 degrees below normal for most, 
and these forecast highs may still be a bit on the warm side. 
Winds will diminish Friday night, yielding a chilly morning on 
Saturday, with lows ranging from the lower 30s to lower 40s across
Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Temperatures thereafter will
slowly moderate back toward normal through the first part of next
week as flow aloft transitions from northwesterly to quasizonal 
and southerly return flow resumes at the surface. Model solutions 
begin to diverge next week, though overall, fairly quiescent 
conditions are expected through midweek with a continued warming 
trend and dry conditions areawide.
