.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Thursday night)
Issued at 213 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Another quiet day is in store before our next weather maker arrives. 
Temperatures have warmed up nicely this afternoon and should reach 
the mid to upper 70s with sunny skies. Tonight will not be as cool 
as last night with southerly return flow increasing dewpoints and 
therefore temperatures slightly. Expect upper 40s and low 50s for 
most. Thursday is when active weather is set to begin its return to 
the area. A shortwave trough is expected to dig into the Four 
Corners by afternoon. A potent jet streak will round the base of 
this trough. This will likely result in high winds across the 
Guadalupe and Delaware Mountains where a High Wind Watch is in 
effect. A Wind Advisory may be needed for the adjacent plains as 
well. Return flow ramps up as lee troughing develops in response to 
this trough with rapid moisture return expected. The exit region of 
the jet streak will lead to synoptic ascent and steep lapse rates 
overspreading the area. The dryline is expected to be retreating 
into portions of the Central Permian Basin late Thursday. 
Eventually, the quickly advancing Pacific Cold Front will meet this 
dryline and erupt into a line of thunderstorms. Near-surface 
stability will be weak and with steep lapse rates aloft, hail and 
damaging winds may be a threat with this convection. This line of 
convection will race eastward with limited rainfall accumulations. 
Behind the cold front, much cooler temperatures, gusty northerly 
winds, and perhaps a few elevated showers remain by Friday
morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Tuesday)
Issued at 213 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

On Friday morning a deep upper low will be located right over the
Permian Basin and will move off to the east through the day. High
pressure will build in from the west Saturday resulting in mild 
wx. A weak trough moving across OK Sunday will link up with the 
old low in the east and a new low off the coast of Srn CA Monday. 
The trough moves over the area Tuesday. The next upper trough 
will move ashore the West Coast Wednesday.

A cold front moving through early Friday will result in temperatures 
15 degrees or cooler than the day before with highs in the 50s 
north... 60s central... with some 70s along the Rio Grande. 
Temperatures begin to recover Saturday with 70s becoming
widespread Sunday. Temps continue to warm next week with 80s 
reappearing by Wednesday.

May still have some wrap around showers with a few storms NE Friday 
across Lea County and the Permian Basin but most of the
rain will be moving off to the east. The trough next week should 
be dry.
