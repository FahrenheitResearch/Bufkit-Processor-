.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Monday)
Issued at 225 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

On Thursday upper trough/low over WY/UT dives south to NM and swings 
right across the area early Friday morning.  This low tracks across 
TX Friday and into AR Saturday with high pressure building in behind 
it. High pressure continues into next week.

Temps will be a few degrees above normal with highs in the mid 70s 
to lower 80s Thursday before another cold front blows through late 
Thursday night/early Friday morning.  Highs Friday and Saturday will 
be 10 to 15 degrees cooler in the 60s... readings in the 70s return 
on Sunday. Lows in the 30s and 40s with 50s returning next week.

High Wind possible in Guadalupe Mountains Thursday but guidance not 
in agreement if it will reach warning criteria at GDP.  Considering 
how the upper low will pass near the mountains bet it will be 
windy... will issue a High Wind Watch.

Could see showers and thunderstorms Thursday night ahead of the 
trough across SE NM and the Permian Basin.  The rest of the forecast 
is dry.
