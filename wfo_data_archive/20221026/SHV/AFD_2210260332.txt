.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Wednesday Night)
Issued at 212 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

A potent upper level trough and associated surface low and cold
front that brought strong to severe convection during the early
morning hours continues to lift northeast away from the forecast
area. Skies are rapidly clearing from west to east as gusty
northwest winds advect drier air into the region. Sustained wind
speeds above 20 kts with gusts above 35 kts have been consistently
observed today. Surface obs over the last couple of hours suggest
that wind speeds may be starting to diminish some over Southeast
Oklahoma and East Texas. Model guidance is in good agreement that
the winds should decease dramatically late this afternoon, so the
Wind Advisory will be maintained for now.

Very light winds are expected overnight. Combined with clear
skies, radiational cooling should allow temperatures to drop 
nicely tonight. Most locations should cool into the 40s. I would 
not be surprised to see a couple of isolated locations in the 
Ouachitas Mountains dip into the upper 30s. However, we should 
remain well above freezing. Similar conditions are expected 
Wednesday night.

Abundant sunshine and much calmer conditions will be the rule for
Wednesday as a surface ridge moves over the Southern Plains.
Northeasterly winds will only be between 5 and 10 kts during the
day Wednesday. The clear skies and dry air should allow
temperatures to quickly rebound during the day. Therefore, I
trended several degrees above the NBM for highs, generally in the
lower to mid 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through next Monday)
Issued at 212 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Starting 12z Thursday...As we wake up Thursday morning, our area 
will start to be under the influence of southwesterly flow aloft as 
a trough digs through the Four Corners region. This trough will 
gradually shift southeastward before closing off over central New 
Mexico by Thursday evening. By Friday morning this closed low will 
now be centered just south of the Texas Panhandle, with showers and 
thunderstorms ongoing across central and east Texas. This activity 
will continue to push east and through the remainder of our area 
through the day Friday as the closed low moves across north central 
Texas and over our area by early Saturday morning. 

By Saturday afternoon the low will push back towards the northeast, 
bringing an end to precipitation from west to east Saturday morning, 
eventually clearing the area by Saturday afternoon. Our area will 
then remain under northwesterly flow aloft through the remainder of 
the weekend and into the start of next week. Afternoon temperatures 
will be seasonable on Wednesday and Thursday with highs ranging from 
the lower to mid 70s both days. Behind the passing closed low and 
associated frontal boundary, temperatures on Friday will remain well 
below seasonable normals for most of the area, however, the eastern 
half of our area will remain under seasonable conditions. Highs on 
Friday will range from the lower 60s across our western and northern 
zones to the lower 70s across our far eastern zones. 

A "warming" trend will then commence on Saturday, with afternoon 
temperatures gradually increasing before returning to the lower to 
mid 70s by Monday. So again, an all too early forecast for Halloween 
is suggesting that temperatures on Monday will be seasonable with 
mostly clear skies. Wednesday night will be our "coolest" night of 
the upcoming long term period as lows will fall into the lower to 
mid 40s. For the rest of the long term, overnight lows will remain 
fairly steady, with temperatures ranging from the mid 40s to lower 
50s across the region through the weekend and into the start of next 
week. /33/

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 610 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Afternoon CU field associated with a sfc low pressure feature 
situated over the Ohio River Valley continues to depart the 
airspace this evening as a steady layer of post frontal dry air 
mixes in across all levels. SKC and VFR conditions will prevail 
through the 26/00z TAF cycle as the sfc associated pressure 
gradient from the aforementioned low pressure center weakens,
altering wind speeds to 5-10 kts across all terminals through
27/00z.
