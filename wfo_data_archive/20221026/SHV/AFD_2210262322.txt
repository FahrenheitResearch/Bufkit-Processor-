.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Thursday Night)
Issued at 115 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Upper-air analysis from this afternoon is showing the low pressure
system responsible for our recent severe weather and rainfall
continuing to move into the northeast. At the same time, our next
weather making system is starting to dig southeastward through
western Idaho. Meanwhile, between systems, our area remains in
near zonal flow aloft. At the surface, high pressure remains in
place across the region which is responsible for these beautiful
blue skies. 

The upper-air trough currently digging into the Pacific Northwest
will gradually push south and east, reaching the Four Corners
region and closing off by Thursday afternoon. By Thursday night,
this closed low will make it to the southwestern Texas Panhandle.
As this system works closer to our area, we should see some
showers increase across our far western zones of east Texas
Thursday night. Current thinking is that precipitation will begin
aross our east Texas counties shortly after or around midnight,
before shifting eastward through the area into Friday. (See Long
Term portion for more information)

Low temperatures tonight will range from the lower to mid 40s
across the region under mostly clear skies. By Thursday morning,
clouds should begin to increase from the west in advance of the
low pressure system heading our way. Temperatures Thursday
afternoon will reach the upper 60s across our northern zones to
the lower and mid 70s elsewhere. /33/

(Friday through next Tuesday)
Issued at 115 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

It continues to look like some much needed rainfall is possible to 
start the weekend, as it now looks like this closed low may be 
taking a more south track. Previous forecasts had the closed low 
move into the region, moving along the I-30 corridor before pulling 
NE. The latest suite of guidance now has the low take a more 
southerly track, which is good news for us when it comes to the rain 
factor. Rain chances should begin to increase on the morning hours 
of Friday, with the heaviest rain falling during the evening and 
overnight hours on Friday. By the time this closed low finally exits 
the region on Sunday, most locations are expected to have seen 
between one and two inches of much needed rainfall. Now, there is 
one scenario that I do need to mention, and that's the unfortunate 
scenario that involves less rainfall. There is a chance that showers 
and thunderstorms develop head of this closed low, south of our 
region. That development would act as a shield, limiting the deep 
moisture return to the area that we'd need to support forecast 
rainfall rates. While this notion is not a heavily supported one 
right now, it's still one that's worth mentioning in the event 
actual observed amounts are lesser.

Temperature wise, given the widespread cloud cover and rainfall, 
temperatures to start the long term will remain just at, or slightly 
below average for this time of the year. Zonal flow, with eventual 
ridging will return to the region to start the next workweek. This 
will lead to temperatures climbing back up to a just above seasonal 
feel to start the new workweek.

(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 605 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Current obs across the airspace continue to support SKC and VFR
conditions through the rest of this evening. Overnight, model
guidance suggests calm winds across the airspace. This combined 
with some model indicated low level moisture east of the Red River
may result in some brief reduction of visibility around KMLU. 
This trend in the models has appeared for other terminals, but 
far later in the morning as daytime heating initiates, limiting 
the chance for sfc vis reduction. Having said that, the idea of 
brief vis reduction ahead of sunrise should not be ruled out. This
will be closely monitored overnight. Past 27/15z SKC and VFR will
prevail ahead of the arrival of light cirrus by 27/21z for 
terminals along and west of the Red River as upper level moisture
advection begins arrive ahead of the upper level trough axis situated
over NM and W/TX by 27/21z.
