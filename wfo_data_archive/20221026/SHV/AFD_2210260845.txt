.SHORT TERM...
(Wednesday through Thursday)
Issued at 344 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

The early morning sfc analysis indicates sfc ridging extending
from the Cntrl Plains S through the Four State Region S into the
Nrn Gulf. Much drier air has spilled S through the area and into 
the Nrn Gulf behind the cold fropa which moved through the region
Tuesday, with the water vapor imagery depicting much drier air
over the Srn Plains and SE CONUS in wake the the closed low now
ejecting NE into the OH Valley. Chamber of commerce weather is
expected to persist through the short term (Thursday night), with
sunny days, cool nights, and max temps remaining near the daily 
norms as the sfc ridging remains in place. The zonal flow aloft 
this morning will eventually transition to SW Thursday, ahead of 
the next digging upper trough now over the Wrn CONUS, which will 
move through the Four Corner Region Thursday, as it begins to 
close off before entering far W TX Friday morning. Thus, an 
increase in elevated moisture (thin cirrus during the day 
Thursday) will gradually thicken during the afternoon and evening,
with some AC cigs increasing later during the evening and 
overnight hours Thursday night. Eventually, the column will 
gradually saturate enough from the top down to allow for areas of 
-RA ahead of the approaching closed low to reach the ground across
portions of E TX/SE OK prior to daybreak Friday. 

In the meantime, a needed break to the gusty winds is in the
offing with the sfc ridge in place, but did trend max temps a bit 
warmer than the NBM today and Thursday, to account for strong 
insolation and the lack of cold advection. Did lower min temps 
slightly lower than the NBM tonight given the strong radiational 
cooling expected, which the NBM does not handle well across our 
area. Some patchy frost can't be ruled out across portions of SE OK, 
adjacent SW AR, and SCntrl AR once winds decouple after sunset.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday Night through Wednesday)
Issued at 344 AM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

A lingering cut-off low will create a wet start to the weekend 
across the Four State Area. Precipitation will be possible through 
Friday and Saturday as medium-range guidance has trended even slower 
with the progression of the upper-level trough as it becomes cut off 
from the mean flow by Friday. As it traverses West Texas, it will 
funnel some Gulf moisture aloft to produce initial chances of rain 
by Friday afternoon (possibly Friday morning). Prolonged dry 
southwesterly flow ahead of this trough, combined with limited low-
level moisture, will reduce the severe weather threat towards the 
lower end hazard-wise. That said, the timing of these showers and 
thunderstorms will be inopportune for Friday night activities, so 
any plans made should account for inclement weather.

By Saturday, precipitation will slowly begin to taper off as the 
surface trough shifts eastward into the Lower Mississippi Valley. 
Wrap-around precipitation will be more likely in northern zones 
before drier conditions finally arrive late on Saturday. After this 
disturbance exits, zonal flow returns along with a gradual warming 
trend through the end of the weekend into next week. Outdoor 
conditions continue to look favorable for Halloween activities with 
temperature maximums and minimums at near normal (highs in the low 
to mid-70s, lows in the lower 50s). Long-range guidance suggests 
ridging that redevelops over that area by the middle of next week, 
pushing temperatures back above normal (potentially approaching the 
80-degree mark in some areas). /16/
