.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 912 PM EDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Calm and mostly stable weather conditions prevailed over the land
areas, but a few stratiform showers developed in the Straits of 
Florida. The land areas remained devoid of showers due to the dry 
continental air mass and below average moisture content. Relative 
humidity values ranged from the upper 20s to middle 30s at 500 to 
250 MB layers, while at 1000 to 850 MB, relative humidity ranged 
from 60 to 70 percent. Although there is meager moisture in the 
lower boundary layer, the lack of mesoscale and synoptic features 
that would bring about ascent continues to plague the region.

Variable and light winds, cold air draining from the Florida 
Peninsula, and mostly clear skies will create favorable conditions
for radiational cooling tonight. Winds have steadily decreased 
this evening and are currently light and variable; winds are 
expected to decouple late tonight. The Key's overnight low 
temperatures will range from the upper 60s to the lower 70s. 
Tomorrow, quiet and warm weather will prevail, with temperatures 
in the mid 80s.

northeast at 5 to 9 knots.  Winds may become light and variable at 
MTH for a few hours this evening.
