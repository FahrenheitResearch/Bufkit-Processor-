.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 1025 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022
A gorgeous day is underway across the Florida Keys and adjacent
coastal waters, with mostly sunny skies, warm, but not so humid
conditions, and light breezes. Current air temperatures in most
Keys island communities are near 80F, with dewpoint temperatures
in the upper 60s, and east-northeast breezes 5-10 mph. Latest Key
West Doppler radar data indicate no precipitation echoes across
the Keys or adjacent coastal waters. The Key West morning
radiosonde balloon revealed a stably stratified troposphere with a
deep layer of very dry air above a subsidence inversion layer
basednear 5000 feet elevation. Light easterlies were confined to
the lowest few thousand feet, with stronger west-northwest winds 
increasing with elevation. 

Current forecasts are on track, with no mid-morning updates
necessary.
