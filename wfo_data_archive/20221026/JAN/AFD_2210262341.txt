.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 218 PM CDT Wed Oct 26 2022

Tonight and tomorrow: A brief period of quasi-zonal flow aloft 
will quickly transition to southwesterlies ahead of a closed upper
low diving through the Four Corners and towards the Southern 
Plains. At the surface, a sprawling high will migrate from the 
Midwest into the Great Lakes region with low-level flow veering in
response. This will bring a quick end to any lingering cold 
advection this evening into tomorrow. Conditions tonight will be 
ideal for efficient radiational cooling with clear skies and light
to calm winds and an entrenched cool/dry airmass. Temperatures 
will quickly fall after sunset as the boundary layer decouples 
with overnight lows bottoming out in the low 40s across much of 
the area. A few readings in the upper 30s will also be possible in
traditional cool drainage locations. Temperatures will quickly 
rebound after sunrise tomorrow with afternoon highs topping out in
the low to mid 70s as warm advection begins to return ahead of 
the upstream wave. /TW/

Thursday night through Tuesday: Come Thursday evening a closed 
low will be shifting southeast of the Four Corners region while a 
>1028mb surface high becomes centered over the eastern Great Lakes
region while ridging south across our CWA. This will keep the 
Gulf closed for our region but a southern branch jet streak within
our southwest flow aloft downstream of the closed low will bring 
some mid and high level clouds across our CWA. These clouds should
help hold temperatures up a few degrees but another night of 
cooler than normal temperatures is expected with most sites 
bottoming out in the upper 40s. Temperatures will moderate going 
into the weekend. The surface high will gradually shift east 
Friday while the closed low moves over the Southern Plains. Friday
morning looks dry but by afternoon the closed low is expected to 
be close enough to our CWA to start moving rain back into our 
southwest zones. The closed low is expected to track east 
northeast to the ArkLaTex region by noon Saturday and become 
nearly stacked with its attendant surface low as it lifts over 
northeast Arkansas Saturday evening. Rain is expected to become 
widespread across our CWA Saturday before tapering off from the 
southwest Saturday night. This system is expected to lift far 
enough to the north Sunday morning and bring an end to the 
measurable rain chances by afternoon. Storm total amounts of one 
to two inches are possible between Friday afternoon and Sunday 
morning. Models still show a shortwave trough swinging through the
region Monday but consensus is still dry for Monday through 
Tuesday. /22/
