.MESOSCALE UPDATE...
Issued at 855 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Current forecast remains on track as we head into the overnight 
period. Current model analysis indicate the cold front pushing east 
out of our CWA as a cooler airmass will begin to filter over our 
forecast area. With this airmass in place, dry conditions will 
continue to dominate our forecast. In response to this, winds should 
maintain a westerly flow through the remainder of the evening with 
gusts up to 10 mph across most of region. With this wind keeping the 
atmosphere better mixed this evening, temperatures will only drop 
into the mid 40s. No major changes were made to the current forecast 
at this time. /CRJ/

.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 227 PM CDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Tonight and Wednesday: The severe storm potential has ended for
our CWA. A gusty west to northwest wind of 30-35mph will continue
through 5pm before subsiding. Rainfall amounts have been light and
generally less than a quarter inch. Otherwise, mid afternoon 
surface analysis had the cold front over our eastern Mississippi 
counties. This cold front will shift east during the next hour or 
two and cooler and much drier air will filter into our CWA. This 
cooler airmass will lead to cooler than normal morning lows 
Wednesday in the 40s. Mid afternoon water vapor imagery/RAP 
analysis showed the circulation around a closed low spinning over 
southern Missouri. This closed low will track east northeast 
tonight and over the Ohio valley by Wednesday morning. It will 
open up as it lifts northeast through the New England states 
Wednesday. This will allow our winds aloft to become near zonal 
Wednesday as surface ridging shifts east over our CWA. This will 
lead to a lighter wind Wednesday but also allow temperatures to 
warm in the upper 60s to lower 70s. This will result in critically
low relative humidity over our delta region so wl mention a 
"Limited" threat for fire danger in our HWO. 

Wednesday night through Monday: Wednesday night the surface ridge
will continue shifting east while our winds aloft become
southwesterly downstream of a shortwave dropping out of the
northwest CONUS. There may be a few high clouds streaming overhead
by morning but temperatures will bottom out cooler than normal
again in the low to mid 40s. The shortwave will close off another
low near the Four Corners region Thursday while a surface high
becomes centered over the Great Lakes region and ridges south
across our CWA. The surface high will gradually shift east through
Friday and keep the Gulf closed over our region into Friday
morning while the closed low moves across the Southern Plains. By
Friday afternoon the closed low is expected to be close enough to
our CWA to start moving rain into our southwest zones. Models are
in fair agreement with the movement of the closed low and rain
becoming more widespread across our CWA Saturday. This system is
expected to lift to the north by Sunday morning ending measurable
rain chances. Storm total amounts look to be in excess of one 
inch. Another shortwave trough may swing through the region Monday
and try to squeeze out some additional light qpf but wl maintain 
the dry consensus for now. /22/
