Today and Tonight...

Quiet conditions will be on tap today across the ArkLaMiss thanks to 
a cold front from the day before. Dry and cooler air has begun to 
filter in across the region keeping temperatures in the upper 60s 
across the north to low 70s across the south. A surface ridge will 
also build in across the region today helping temperatures at bay. 
While most places saw rain yesterday associated with the cold front, 
the dry air behind the front will be strong enough to knock dew 
points down below 30% across areas in the northwest and areas west 
of the Mississippi river. Because of this, will continue the current 
Limited threat for fire danger today for those areas. 

As the surface ridge continues to push east tonight, winds could 
range from 5-10 mph across areas in the north. Outside of that, 
expect a quiet evening/night. Low temperatures will be on the cooler 
side, in fact cooler than normal for this time of year. Temperatures 
will mainly be in the lower 40s area wide. /JNE/

Thursday through next Tuesday...

Conditions will subtly warm across the forecast area Thursday 
into Friday ahead of the next system set to lift across the region
over the weekend. Regardless, high pressure will sit in control 
of our weather during this time despite sliding further east of 
the region. Highs Thursday will generally range from the upper 60s
to middle 70s, while warming into the mid and upper 70s on 
Friday. Lows likewise warm, especially Friday night, with mid and 
upper 40s forecast Thursday night and mid and upper 50s Friday 
night.

Rain chances will begin increasing across the CWA late in the day on 
Friday, with chances remaining over the area Friday night through 
late Saturday night as a closed low pressure system tracks east and 
northeast from Texas and across the region. At the surface, a low 
will form and lift northeast across the forecast area through the 
weekend.

While most of the rain currently looks to come to an end overnight 
Saturday into early Sunday, some wrap around moisture will result in 
at least some cloud cover lingering across the CWA Sunday into 
Monday, despite high pressure building into the region in the 
system's wake. As the system continues to slowly lift out overnight 
Monday, a return to mostly clear skies is expected as the high 
pressure center moves east across the region. /19/
