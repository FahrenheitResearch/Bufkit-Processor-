.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Friday) 
Issued at 215 PM MDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Zonal flow aloft tonight with a weak embedded disturbance coming
out of northern Colorado late. Models increase cloud cover with
ceilings around 9-12kft by 12z, mainly north of Interstate 70. A
few of the high res models showing trace amounts of precipitation
but thinking mostly virga with those ceilings and dry low levels.
None of the hires models are reducing visibility, so not expecting
any impacts regardless. Lows will be in the lower 30s. Clouds will
persist through Wednesday as the upper low moves from the Pacific
northwest to western Colorado. Precipitation chances will hold off
until Wednesday night. Highs will be similar to today in the low
to mid 60s. Rain chances will be best after midnight through
Thursday morning, with up to a tenth of an inch possible in
northeastern portion of the area, McCook to Norton, then
precipitation chances start moving east Thursday afternoon, 
ending Thursday night. High temperatures on Thursday only in the
50s with clouds and precipitation. Lows Thursday night will range
from the lower 20s in northeast Colorado where skies will clear to
the upper 30s in north central Kansas where clouds will linger. On
Friday will see shortwave ridging behind the departing system and
clearing skies. Highs will be in the lower 60s and lows Friday
night in the upper 20s to lower 30s. Winds will be light.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Tuesday) 
Issued at 215 PM MDT Tue Oct 25 2022

Tranquil weather expected through the long term period with no
precipitation and temperatures slightly above normal. There will
be an upper trough over the eastern CONUS and a low amplitude 
ridge over the southern plains, placing the central plains mostly 
under weak northwest to zonal flow. About the only concern for the
local area will be the return of elevated fire weather conditions
beginning on Sunday as afternoon relative humidity minimums fall 
below 20 percent. However, wind speeds are currently expected to 
remain well below critical criteria through the period.
