...PATCHY DENSE FOG ALONG THE COAST...

Marine fog is moving inland tonight with visibilities between one
half to one mile and locally one quarter mile. Expect 
visibilities to continue to worsen overnight as fog pushes inland.

Motorists should be alert for sudden changes in visibility due to
the areas of dense fog. Drive at reduced speeds and use low beam 
headlights only.
