AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Wakefield VA
326 AM EDT Wed Oct 26 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Fog is expected to persist through the morning before gradually
lifting. A few showers are possible later today ahead of a cold
front. High pressure north of the area builds southward from
Friday through Saturday. Another low pressure system impacts the
local area early next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
As of 325 AM EDT Wednesday...

Early morning wx analysis shows weak high pressure over eastern 
portions of VA and NC, with low pressure over the srn Great Lakes 
(and a trailing cold front extending southward into GA). Once again, 
widespread fog has developed, but the lowest visibilities (so far) 
are near the coast. While VSBYs are not aob 1/4SM in all locations 
near the bay/coast, it is still enough to warrant a Dense Fog 
Advisory from the MD Ern Shore to Hampton Roads and NE NC. The DFA 
is in effect until 10 AM. Elsewhere, have issued an SPS for 
localized VSBYs of 1/2SM or less. Will continue to monitor to see if 
the DFA needs to be expanded. There may be brief, temporary 
improvements in visibility (to 1-3SM) near the coast as light 
showers track over the area between now and 6 AM.

The surface low deepens as it tracks into Quebec through tonight 
while the trailing cold front crosses the area from west to east 
from this aftn-evening. A few showers are possible west of I-95 this 
morning, with a 20% chc of showers expanding to most areas during 
the aftn-evening (with the cold FROPA). There will be a modest 
increase in low-level SSW flow today. This should allow for low
clouds to lift by early-mid aftn across SE VA and NE NC. 
However, am not as confident in low clouds lifting across inland
portions of the area with clouds and showers moving in from the
west. Skies should at least partially clear inland by late 
aftn-early evening (behind the cold front). Undercut NBM by a 
few degrees for highs today given the expectation of lingering 
low clouds. Forecast highs range from the mid-upper 60s for most
inland zones (and the Lower Ern Shore) with low-mid 70s in far 
SE VA and NE NC. It is important to note that some of the CAMs 
still only have low 60s for highs in areas west of I-95. Not 
expecting much in the way of measurable rainfall today as deep 
moisture will be in short supply. Any lingering showers will be 
confined to the coast by evening and well offshore after 
midnight as the cold front moves offshore. Overnight lows range 
from the mid-upper 40s W to the mid 50s along the coast. 

&&

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
As of 325 AM EDT Wednesday...

~1030mb sfc high pressure builds over the Great Lakes on Thursday 
and strengthens to ~1036mb as it becomes centered near Montreal by 
Friday (with sfc ridging extending southward into VA and the 
Carolinas). Dry wx prevails on Thursday with high temperatures in 
the mid 60s to low 70s. Overnight lows cool into the low 40s NW
to the low 50s in SE VA and NE NC. Winds turn NE on Friday (and
could gust to 30 mph at the coast) as high pressure translates 
eastward. Increasing onshore flow/moisture will cause BKN low 
stratus to spread from E to W on Friday, keeping temperatures 
generally in the 60s (mid-upper 50s possible in the central VA 
Piedmont). Remaining dry Friday night with lows in the 40s 
inland and low to mid 50s near the water with the continued 
onshore flow.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
As of 325 AM EDT Wednesday...

High pressure ridges southward Saturday into Sunday as low pressure 
approaches from the Gulf Coast/Deep South. Another area of low 
pressure moves northward offshore and could bring a few showers 
to coastal NE NC Saturday (but will keep PoPs below 15% as 
moisture will be limited). The low pressure system is progged 
to track from the Deep South to the Mid-Atlantic from Sunday 
through early next week. Blended guidance continues to show some
potential for light precip Sunday morning but will limit PoPs 
to slight chance until deeper moisture arrives later Sunday into
Monday and lingers into early Tuesday before moving offshore. 
High temps inch upward through the 60s Sat/Sun with upper 60s to
mid 70s by Mon/Tue. Lows range from the lower 40s-mid 50s 
Sunday morning with mainly 50s on Mon/Tue.

.AVIATION /08Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
As of 135 AM EDT Wednesday...

Widespread fog has overspread the terminals early this morning
with VSBYs of 1/4-1SM (and CIGs of 200-300ft AGL). The fog (and
LIFR to VLIFR conditions) will persist through 13-15z before
gradually lifting. Even after the fog lifts, IFR to LIFR CIGs
will likely linger into the midday to early aftn timeframe
before becoming MVFR to VFR and potentially scattering out. CIGs
should become VFR at all of the terminals by 21-00z. Winds will
be generally light and variable this morning, becoming SSW 5-10 
kt later today. Patchy drizzle is possible this morning, and a 
few showers will be possible this afternoon/evening along and
ahead of a cold front pushing through. However, confidence in 
coverage remains too low to reflect in the TAFs.

Winds shift to the N-NE behind the cold front tonight with 
MVFR stratus possible in SE VA/NE NC. VFR conditions are
expected on Thursday. Low stratus may result in flight
restrictions Thu night into Friday.

.MARINE...
As of 325 AM EDT Wednesday...

Early this morning, weak high pressure remains centered over the 
local waters leading to generally light and variable winds. 
Widespread fog has set in over the waters early this morning with 
visibilities as low as 1/4 to 1/2 NM at times. As a result, a Marine 
Dense Fog Advisory remains in effect through 10 AM this morning. It 
is possible the DFA may need to be extended for a few more hours, 
especially over the northern coastal waters. 

High pressure gradually shifts to the east today, allowing for winds 
to become SSE and increase to around 10 knots by this afternoon. 
Meanwhile, a cold front will be approaching the region from the west 
today and eventually cross the waters later this evening into 
tonight. Behind the front, winds become N to NW and increase to 15 
to 20 knots with gusts to 25 knots. As a result, a Small Craft 
Advisory is now in effect for all waters outside of the upper rivers 
starting late tonight. It remains breezy through much of the day 
Thursday before winds take on a NE component and a secondary surge 
develops Thursday night. Strong high pressure builds from the 
Eastern Great Lakes into New England through the weekend allowing 
for an extended period of NE flow over the waters. SCAs will likely 
need to be extended through Saturday (longer for the coastal waters 
due to seas of 5+ ft). Seas will range from 2 to 4 feet today, 
before building to 4 to 5 feet later tonight through Thursday. Seas 
build further to 5 to 8 feet Friday into the weekend.
