.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 128 PM MDT Thu Oct 26 2023

A transition to more typical fall weather remains on track to
begin on Friday in eastern New Mexico in the form of a weak 
backdoor cold front, low clouds and areas of drizzle or light rain.
The much stronger cold front is still expected to push through
the eastern plains Saturday evening, surging west and south
Saturday night into Sunday morning. An area of light precipitation,
mainly in the form of light rain and snow with little accumulation
expected, will accompany the cold front starting Sunday and 
continuing into Sunday night. Widespread lower elevation hard 
freezes also remain on track for at least Sunday and Monday 
mornings.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Friday night)
Issued at 128 PM MDT Thu Oct 26 2023

Stronger southwest and west winds at the base of an upper level 
trough are over the Land of Enchantment this afternoon with winds of 
15 to 25 kts gusting up to 35 kts common along and east of the 
central mountain chain. These winds should quickly let up after 
sunset due to the ABL decoupling. Attention then turns to northeast 
NM. A backdoor front currently across northeast and east central 
Colorado will surge south on the backside of the aforementioned 
upper level trough moving through the northern Great Plains. This 
backdoor front will enter northeast NM around 27/06Z with gusty 
northeasterly winds of around 10 to 20 kts on the leading edge. The 
front will make it through most of the eastern plains and be along 
the east slopes of the central mountain chain by sunrise. There is a 
possibility of some low clouds along the leading edge of the 
backdoor front but skies should clear past the leading edge due to 
drier air working in. For areas outside of eastern NM, it will be a 
relatively quiet night with mostly clear skies, light winds and lows 
around 3 to 7 degrees above seasonal averages.

Easterly flow behind the backdoor front will result in a cooler day 
across eastern NM with temperatures around 10 to as much as 25 
degrees lower than today! Southeasterly winds along the east slopes 
of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains will be breezy to locally windy 
due to a tight sfc pressure gradient. High temperatures for central 
and western NM will be similar to today with mostly sunny skies. 
Some mid to high level clouds will develop along southwesterly 
facing slopes of the Chuska and Tusa Mountains Friday afternoon due 
to upper level southwesterly flow ahead of the next upper level 
trough diving southeast into the northern Rockies and this will 
continue heading into Friday night. 

The incoming upper level trough, along with surface high pressure 
shifting east over the Dakotas, will result in moist southeasterly 
return flow over southeast and east central NM shortly after sunset. 
This will cause dewpoints to increase into the 50s allowing low 
clouds, patchy drizzle, and light rain to develop. Stronger surface 
winds do not promote the development of fog, so did not include it 
across the aforementioned area. Outside of the eastern plains and 
the far northwest, it will be a clear cool night with lows around 5 
to 10 degrees above seasonal averages.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Wednesday)
Issued at 128 PM MDT Thu Oct 26 2023

Omega block centered over the Gulf of AK will allow two separate
short-wave troughs to merge with one another over NV/UT on
Saturday. The stronger, more northern wave is accompanied by a 
modified arctic airmass that will plow southward through eastern 
NM Saturday night. Weather prediction models remain in good 
agreement with regard to the timing of this significant front. 
Initially, the front is forecast to move through Clayton around 
sunset Saturday, progressing south and westward to the east slopes
of the central mountain chain by about sunrise Sunday. The cold 
air will be forced through the canyons of the central mountain 
chain Sunday morning. East canyon winds into the ABQ metro and RGV
as a whole will be surface pressure gradient driven with 
southwest flow aloft at 700 mb (~10K ft MSL) much of Sunday. GFS 
and ECMWF are in excellent agreement with regard to the timing 
and placement of the baroclinic (strong temperature difference) 
band of rain, snow, and possibly isolated thunderstorms for 
Sunday. Both global models also keep the main upper trough axis 
near the Four Corners, aiding in the trough's ability to keep lift
going over much of central and northern NM in the form of 
isentropic upglide (relatively warm air getting forced up and over
colder air at and near the surface). This system's potential will
have to be monitored closely given this overall classic winter 
storm-like set-up and the possibility for impactful weather in 
the form of accumulating snow for much of north-central and 
northeast NM Sunday. There is also the potential for light 
freezing rain accumulation in the far eastern plains Saturday
night and again Sunday. Additionally, cold overnight lows and the
associated hard freezes kick in for lower elevation areas Sunday 
through Tuesday mornings. Tuesday morning may end up being the 
coldest morning areawide. 

Halloween evening looks picture perfect for Trick or Treaters 
with temperatures in the upper 40s to mid 50s most places and no 
wind or precipitation to speak of.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 418 PM MDT Thu Oct 26 2023

VFR conditions prevail and will persist through the TAF period,
except for potential brief MVFR cigs at KTCC and KLVS behind a
backdoor cold front late tonight into Friday morning. However,
MVFR probabilities are too low to include in TAFs at this time.
Otherwise, gusty west-southwest winds will diminish this evening.
The wind shift associated with the backdoor cold front will hit 
KTCC around 09Z with gusts to between 20-25kt and eventually reach
KROW around 15Z. 

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 128 PM MDT Thu Oct 26 2023

No critical fire weather is expected during the forecast period with 
the exception of patchy areas in west central New Mexico tomorrow 
afternoon. A backdoor cold front will move into northeast New Mexico 
tonight with breezy northerly and northeasterly winds across eastern 
NM. This will result in cooler high temperatures and higher minimum 
relative humidities on Friday. Another stronger backdoor cold front 
arrives to the northeast corner of New Mexico Saturday evening, with 
much colder temperatures in it's wake and potentially bringing light 
wintery precipitation to the eastern plains near the Texas border 
Saturday night. Higher relative humidities from wintry precipitation 
will also be possible across the northern mountains Sunday afternoon 
into Sunday night ahead of a storm system. Widespread poor 
ventilation is also likely Sunday and Monday in the wake of the 
backdoor front due to a low stratus deck in place. Ventilation 
improves mid-week as dry, warmer westerly flow erodes the low 
stratus deck across the eastern plains.
